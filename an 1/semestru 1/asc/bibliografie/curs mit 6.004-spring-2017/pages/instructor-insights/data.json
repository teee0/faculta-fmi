A rudimentary knowledge of programming language concepts and electrical fundamentals is assumed. Requirements Satisfied 6.004 can be applied toward a degree in Electrical Science and Engineering, but is not required. 6.004 can be applied toward a degree in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, but is not required. Offered Every fall and spring semester\nAssessment Grade Breakdown The students\u0026rsquo; grades were based on the following activities:\n56% Quizzes 35% Labs (nonzero score required on each lab) 9% Design project Student Information Enrollment Between 2008 and 2018, the enrollment for 6.004 rose from about 100 to 200-300 per semester.\nBreakdown by Year Mostly sophomores, but also others, ranging from freshmen to graduate students.\nBreakdown by Major About 4/5 Electrical Engineering and Computer Science majors, 1/5 other.\nTypical Student Background Some students came to the class with prior experience in programming and some understanding of how computers are structured; others came knowing little more than how to use a browser.\nHow Student Time Was Spent During an average week, students were expected to spend 12 hours on the course, roughly divided as follows:\nIn Class Met 2 times per week for 1 hour per session;Â 24 sessions total. Class sessions were lecture-based and focused on the engineering of digital systems. Recitation Met 2 times per week for 1 hour per session; 26 sessions total. Recitation groups contained 20-30 students on average and allowed students to work through practice problems and ask questions of the recitation instructors. Out of Class Outside of class, students completed seven lab assignments, worked through the online materials and practice problems in the MITx version of the course, and prepared a design project.
