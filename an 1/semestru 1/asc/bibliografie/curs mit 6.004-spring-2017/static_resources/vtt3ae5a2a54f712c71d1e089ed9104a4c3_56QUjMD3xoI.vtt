00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:05.980
Okay, now let's apply all this analysis to
improving the performance of our circuits.

00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:11.519
The latency of a combinational logic circuit
is simply its propagation delay t_PD.

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:16.949
And the throughput is just 1/t_PD since we
start processing the next input only after

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:21.089
finishing the computation on the current input.

00:00:21.089 --> 00:00:26.029
Consider a combinational system with three
components: F, G, and H, where F and G work

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:31.630
in parallel to produce the inputs to H.
Using this timing diagram we can follow the

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:37.840
processing of a particular input value X.
Sometime after X is valid and stable, the

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:43.080
F and G modules produce their outputs F(X)
and G(X).

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:47.910
Now that the inputs to H are valid and stable,
the H module will produce the system output

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:52.640
P(X) after a delay set by the propagation
delay of H.

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:57.450
The total elapsed time from valid input to
valid output is determined by the propagation

00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:00.000
delays of the component modules.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.739
Assuming we use those modules as-is, we can't
make any improvements on this latency.

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:08.729
But what about the system's throughput?

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:13.679
Observe that after producing their outputs,
the F and G modules are sitting sitting idle,

00:01:13.679 --> 00:01:18.380
just holding their outputs stable while H
performs its computation.

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:23.069
Can we figure out a way for F and G to get
started processing the next input while still

00:01:23.069 --> 00:01:26.460
letting H do its job on the first input?

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:31.069
In other words, can we divide the processing
of the combinational circuit into two stages

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:37.740
where the first stage computes F(X) and G(X),
and the second stage computes H(X)?

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:42.259
If we can, then we can increase the throughput
of the system.

00:01:42.259 --> 00:01:48.109
Mr. Blue's inspiration is to use registers
to hold the values F(X) and G(X) for use by

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:53.389
H, while the F and G modules start working
on the next input value.

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:57.399
To make our timing analysis a little easier,
we'll assume that our pipelining registers

00:01:57.399 --> 00:02:01.700
have a zero propagation delay and setup time.

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:05.811
The appropriate clock period for this sequential
circuit is determined by the propagation delay

00:02:05.811 --> 00:02:07.670
of the slowest processing stage.

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:15.810
In this example, the stage with F and G needs
a clock period of at least 20 ns to work correctly.

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:20.840
And the stage with H needs a clock period
of 25 ns to work correctly.

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:27.030
So the second stage is the slowest and sets
the system clock period at 25 ns.

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:30.940
This will be our general plan for increasing
the throughput of combinational logic:

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:36.380
we'll use registers to divide the processing
into a sequence of stages, where the registers

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:41.720
capture the outputs from one processing stage
and hold them as inputs for the next processing

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:42.920
stage.

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:47.540
A particular input will progress through the
system at the rate of one stage per clock

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:49.320
cycle.

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:53.340
In this example, there are two stages in the
processing pipeline and the clock period is

00:02:53.340 --> 00:03:00.950
25 ns, so the latency of the pipelined system
is 50 ns, i.e., the number of stages times

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:03.410
the system's clock period.

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:07.990
The latency of the pipeline system is a little
longer than the latency of the unpipelined

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:08.990
system.

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:14.980
However, the pipeline system produces 1 output
every clock period, or 25 ns.

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:19.520
The pipeline system has considerably better
throughput at the cost of a small increase

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:21.950
in latency.

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:26.620
Pipeline diagrams help us visualize the operation
of a pipelined system.

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:31.600
The rows of the pipeline diagram represent
the pipeline stages and the columns are successive

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:33.660
clock cycles.

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:39.790
At the beginning of clock cycle i the input
X_i becomes stable and valid.

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:44.760
Then during clock cycle i the F and G modules
process that input and at the end of the cycle

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:51.020
the results F(X_i) and G(X_i) are captured
by the pipeline registers between the first

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:53.010
and second stages.

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:59.270
Then in cycle i+1, H uses the captured values
do its share of the processing of X_i.

00:03:59.270 --> 00:04:05.510
And, meanwhile, the F and G modules are working
on X_i+1.

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:11.100
You can see that the processing for a particular
input value moves diagonally through the diagram,

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:14.570
one pipeline stage per clock cycle.

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:19.510
At the end of cycle i+1, the output of H is
captured by the final pipeline register and

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:22.900
is available for use during cycle i+2.

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:27.870
The total time elapsed between the arrival
of an input and the availability of the output

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:30.410
is two cycles.

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:36.550
The processing continues cycle after cycle,
producing a new output every clock cycle.

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:40.090
Using the pipeline diagram we can track how
a particular input progresses through the

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:44.780
system or see what all the stages are doing
in any particular cycle.

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:52.060
We'll define a K-stage pipeline (or K-pipeline
for short) as an acyclic circuit having exactly

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:56.120
K registers on every path from input to output.

00:04:56.120 --> 00:05:00.920
An unpipelined combinational circuit is thus
a 0-stage pipeline.

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:05.340
To make it easy to build larger pipelined
systems out of pipelined components, we'll

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:11.870
adopt the convention that every pipeline stage,
and hence every K-stage pipeline, has a register

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:12.920
on its output.

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:17.960
We'll use the techniques we learned for analyzing
the timing of sequential circuits to ensure

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:23.340
the clock signal common to all the pipeline
registers has a period sufficient to ensure

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:26.370
correct operation of each stage.

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:32.740
So for every register-to-register and input-to-register
path, we need to compute the sum of the propagation

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:37.470
delay of the input register, plus the propagation
delay of the combinational logic, plus the

00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:40.050
setup time of the output register.

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:44.080
Then we'll choose the system's clock period
to be greater than or equal to the largest

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:45.600
such sum.

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:50.290
With the correct clock period and exactly
K-registers along each path from system input

00:05:50.290 --> 00:05:55.590
to system output, we are guaranteed that the
K-pipeline will compute the same outputs as

00:05:55.590 --> 00:05:59.750
the original unpipelined combinational circuit.

00:05:59.750 --> 00:06:04.720
The latency of a K-pipeline is K times the
period of the system's clock.

00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:09.970
And the throughput of a K-pipeline is the
frequency of the system's clock, i.e., 1 over

00:06:09.970 --> 00:06:10.789
the clock period.
