1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:02,940
Now we get to the fun part!

2
00:00:02,940 --> 00:00:07,990
To build other logic gates, we'll design complementary
pullup and pulldown circuits, hooked up as

3
00:00:07,990 --> 00:00:12,760
shown in the diagram on the right, to control
the voltage of the output node.

4
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:17,449
"Complementary" refers to property that when
one of the circuits is conducting, the other

5
00:00:17,449 --> 00:00:19,589
is not.

6
00:00:19,589 --> 00:00:24,169
When the pullup circuit is conducting and
the pulldown circuit is not, the output node

7
00:00:24,169 --> 00:00:30,009
has a connection to V_DD and its output voltage
will quickly rise to become a valid digital

8
00:00:30,009 --> 00:00:31,779
1 output.

9
00:00:31,779 --> 00:00:36,790
Similarly, when the pulldown circuit is conducting
and the pullup is not, the output node has

10
00:00:36,790 --> 00:00:41,309
a connection to GROUND and its output voltage
will quickly fall to become a valid digital

11
00:00:41,309 --> 00:00:43,739
0 output.

12
00:00:43,739 --> 00:00:47,730
If the circuits are incorrectly designed so
that they are not complementary and could

13
00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:53,600
both be conducting for an extended period
of time, there's a path between V_DD and GROUND

14
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:58,390
and large amounts of short circuit current
will flow, a very bad idea.

15
00:00:58,390 --> 00:01:02,699
Since our simple switch model won't let us
determine the output voltage in this case,

16
00:01:02,699 --> 00:01:06,780
we'll call this output value "X" or unknown.

17
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:12,470
Another possibility with a non-complementary
pullup and pulldown is that neither is conducting

18
00:01:12,470 --> 00:01:16,080
and the output node has no connection to either
power supply voltage.

19
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:21,020
At this point, the output node is electrically
floating and whatever charge is stored by

20
00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:25,210
the nodal capacitance will stay there, at
least for a while.

21
00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:30,560
This is a form of memory and we'll come back
to this in a couple of lectures.

22
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:34,770
For now, we'll concentrate on the behavior
of devices with complementary pullups and

23
00:01:34,770 --> 00:01:37,189
pulldowns.

24
00:01:37,189 --> 00:01:41,899
Since the pullup and pulldown circuits are
complementary, we'll see there's a nice symmetry

25
00:01:41,899 --> 00:01:43,689
in their design.

26
00:01:43,689 --> 00:01:48,689
We've already seen the simplest complementary
circuit: a single NFET pulldown and a single

27
00:01:48,689 --> 00:01:50,729
PFET pullup.

28
00:01:50,729 --> 00:01:55,640
If the same signal controls both switches,
it's easy to see that when one switch is on,

29
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:58,700
the other switch is off.

30
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:03,759
Now consider a pulldown circuit consisting
of two NFET switches in series.

31
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:08,470
There's a connection through both switches
when A is 1 and B is 1.

32
00:02:08,470 --> 00:02:13,750
For any other combination of A and B values,
one or the other of the switches (or both!)

33
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:15,890
will be off.

34
00:02:15,890 --> 00:02:21,790
The complementary circuit to NFET switches
in series is PFET switches in parallel.

35
00:02:21,790 --> 00:02:26,390
There's a connection between the top and bottom
circuit nodes when either of the PFET switches

36
00:02:26,390 --> 00:02:31,980
is on, i.e., when A is 0 or B is 0.

37
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:40,440
As a thought experiment consider all possible
pairs of values for A and B: 00, 01, 10, and

38
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:42,090
11.

39
00:02:42,090 --> 00:02:48,400
When one or both of the inputs is 0, the series
NFET circuit is not conducting and parallel

40
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:50,470
PFET circuit is.

41
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:56,370
And when both inputs are 1, the series NFET
circuit is conducting but the parallel PFET

42
00:02:56,370 --> 00:02:59,500
circuit is not.

43
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:04,540
Finally consider the case where we have parallel
NFETs and series PFETs.

44
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:07,900
Conduct the same thought experiment as above
to convince yourself that when one of the

45
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:11,600
circuits is conducting the other isn't.

46
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:17,090
Let's put these observations to work when
building our next CMOS combinational device.

47
00:03:17,090 --> 00:03:23,370
In this device, we're using series NFETs in
the pulldown and parallel PFETs in the pullup,

48
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:28,320
circuits that we convinced ourselves were
complementary in the previous slide.

49
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:32,990
We can build a tabular representation, called
a truth table, that describes the value of

50
00:03:32,990 --> 00:03:38,450
Z for all possible combinations of the input
values for A and B.

51
00:03:38,450 --> 00:03:45,311
When A and B are 0, the PFETs are on and the
NFETs are off, so Z is connected to V_DD and

52
00:03:45,311 --> 00:03:48,040
the output of the device is a digital 1.

53
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:54,100
In fact, if either A or B is 0 [CLICK, CLICK]
that continues to be the case, and the value

54
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:56,540
of Z is still 1.

55
00:03:56,540 --> 00:04:01,790
Only when both A and B are 1 [CLICK], will
both NFETs be on and the value of Z become

56
00:04:01,790 --> 00:04:03,120
0.

57
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:08,140
This particular device is called a NAND gate,
short for "NOT-AND", a function that is the

58
00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:11,620
inverse of the AND function.

59
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:16,100
Returning to a physical view for a moment,
the figure on the left is a bird's eye view,

60
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:20,370
looking down on the surface of the integrated
circuit, showing how the MOSFETs are laid

61
00:04:20,370 --> 00:04:22,350
out in two dimensions.

62
00:04:22,350 --> 00:04:27,969
The blue material represents metal wires with
large top and bottom metal runs connecting

63
00:04:27,969 --> 00:04:30,550
to V_DD and GROUND.

64
00:04:30,550 --> 00:04:35,900
The red material forms the polysilicon gate
nodes, the green material the n-type source/drain

65
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:40,930
diffusions for the NFETs and the tan material
the p-type source/drain diffusions for the

66
00:04:40,930 --> 00:04:41,930
PFETs.

67
00:04:41,930 --> 00:04:48,210
Can you see that the NFETs are connected in
series and the PFETs in parallel?

68
00:04:48,210 --> 00:04:54,439
Just to give you a sense of the costs of making
a single NAND gate, the yellow box is a back-of-the-envelope

69
00:04:54,439 --> 00:05:00,690
calculation showing that we can manufacture
approximately 26 billion NAND gates on a single

70
00:05:00,690 --> 00:05:07,620
300mm (that's 12 inches for us non-metric
folks) silicon wafer.

71
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:13,800
For the older IC manufacturing process shown
here, it costs about $3500 to buy the materials

72
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:19,710
and perform the manufacturing steps needed
to form the circuitry for all those NAND gates.

73
00:05:19,710 --> 00:05:23,849
So the final cost is a bit more than 100 nano-dollars
per NAND gate.

74
00:05:23,849 --> 00:05:26,830
I think this qualifies as both cheap and small!
