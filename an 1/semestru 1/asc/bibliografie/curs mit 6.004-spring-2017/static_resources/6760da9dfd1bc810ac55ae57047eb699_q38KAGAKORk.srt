1
00:00:05,660 --> 00:00:08,090
SARAH HANSEN: So how did
you become interested

2
00:00:08,090 --> 00:00:10,228
in computation structures?

3
00:00:10,228 --> 00:00:12,020
CHRISTOPHER TERMAN:
Well, in the early '70s

4
00:00:12,020 --> 00:00:15,470
I was a college student trying
to earn my way through college.

5
00:00:15,470 --> 00:00:19,550
And so I was the computer
operator on the third shift

6
00:00:19,550 --> 00:00:21,200
for the campus computer.

7
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:24,150
That was in the era in which
you could only afford one.

8
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:26,960
And since watching the
blinking lights was boring,

9
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:30,530
I pulled out the schematics
for the computer I

10
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:34,010
was running for the university.

11
00:00:34,010 --> 00:00:37,880
And I started trying to figure
out how the computer worked.

12
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:41,370
Ever since then, it's been
sort of a lifelong interest

13
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:43,820
in figuring out,
how do they actually

14
00:00:43,820 --> 00:00:46,220
put together these components
to make a machine that

15
00:00:46,220 --> 00:00:48,620
can do computation?

16
00:00:48,620 --> 00:00:50,060
SARAH HANSEN: And
that interest is

17
00:00:50,060 --> 00:00:52,730
coupled with your interest
in teaching and learning,

18
00:00:52,730 --> 00:00:56,145
and especially online education.

19
00:00:56,145 --> 00:00:57,770
Could you talk a
little bit about where

20
00:00:57,770 --> 00:01:00,020
that interest comes from?

21
00:01:00,020 --> 00:01:04,970
CHRISTOPHER TERMAN: Well,
I was always fascinated

22
00:01:04,970 --> 00:01:09,650
and very motivated by the great
teachers I could listen to.

23
00:01:09,650 --> 00:01:12,440
And so everybody picks
a model when they're

24
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:14,150
a teenager or a young
adult. They say,

25
00:01:14,150 --> 00:01:15,710
I want to be like so-and-so.

26
00:01:15,710 --> 00:01:17,270
Well, the so-and-sos
I liked to pick

27
00:01:17,270 --> 00:01:19,280
were the excellent
teachers I had.

28
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:22,820
So I said, I'm going to try
to be the best teacher I can.

29
00:01:22,820 --> 00:01:25,670
There's something very
satisfying about teaching

30
00:01:25,670 --> 00:01:28,160
students and having them
nod and suddenly get it.

31
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:35,940
So it's been sort of a very
fulfilling experience to teach.

32
00:01:35,940 --> 00:01:38,270
And so that's sort of a
virtuous cycle, right?

33
00:01:38,270 --> 00:01:40,580
You get good vibes
from teaching.

34
00:01:40,580 --> 00:01:42,290
And then you do it
better next year.

35
00:01:42,290 --> 00:01:43,340
And you get better vibes.

36
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:46,370
And so for 40 years,
that's been a great--

37
00:01:46,370 --> 00:01:48,078
it's been great.

38
00:01:48,078 --> 00:01:50,120
SARAH HANSEN: What kind
of background experiences

39
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:52,700
do the students bring related
to computation structures?

40
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:53,920
CHRISTOPHER TERMAN:
It's all over the map.

41
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:54,890
It's all over the map.

42
00:01:54,890 --> 00:01:59,390
So some of them will come
having programmed computers

43
00:01:59,390 --> 00:02:01,730
for a long time, and maybe
even know a little bit

44
00:02:01,730 --> 00:02:05,030
about how the computers are
structured on the insides.

45
00:02:05,030 --> 00:02:07,220
Other people have
not done beans.

46
00:02:07,220 --> 00:02:10,070
They're just-- I wanted
to take a course.

47
00:02:10,070 --> 00:02:13,130
I've used computers,
sort of browsers,

48
00:02:13,130 --> 00:02:14,750
laptops, email, sort of thing.

49
00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:20,960
But they have no idea about
the OS or the actual hardware

50
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:21,950
inside.

51
00:02:21,950 --> 00:02:25,670
And so they come with interest,
but no background at all.

52
00:02:25,670 --> 00:02:29,120
SARAH HANSEN: So how do
you structure a course

53
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:32,300
to meet the needs of people with
diverse backgrounds like that?

54
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:33,383
CHRISTOPHER TERMAN: Right.

55
00:02:33,383 --> 00:02:40,100
So to handle really
diverse backgrounds,

56
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:42,830
you have to have a huge
range of materials.

57
00:02:42,830 --> 00:02:44,800
So you need something
that somebody who just--

58
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,370
I need to start
at the beginning.

59
00:02:46,370 --> 00:02:48,410
You need a beginning
for them to start at.

60
00:02:48,410 --> 00:02:50,823
And for somebody who's
sort of past the first half

61
00:02:50,823 --> 00:02:52,740
of your material, you
need a second half which

62
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:54,590
will engage their interests.

63
00:02:54,590 --> 00:02:56,760
So I create a huge--

64
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:58,040
I think of it as a buffet.

65
00:02:58,040 --> 00:02:59,590
There's lots of dishes.

66
00:02:59,590 --> 00:03:01,700
And you can start at the
beginning of the buffet

67
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:04,910
and sort of pick
it up from scratch.

68
00:03:04,910 --> 00:03:08,300
Or you can say, I'll skip
the first couple courses,

69
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:11,000
and I'm ready to dive
in sort of in the middle

70
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,650
of the conversation somewhere.

71
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:15,680
So I think the real key
is having a huge selection

72
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:17,060
of materials to draw from.

73
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:20,810
And that's, I think, one
of the hallmarks of 6.004

74
00:03:20,810 --> 00:03:24,958
has been that we have
every possible way

75
00:03:24,958 --> 00:03:26,000
of learning the material.

76
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,490
So not only for
different backgrounds,

77
00:03:28,490 --> 00:03:30,300
but for different
learning styles.

78
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:33,770
So some students want
to talk or listen.

79
00:03:33,770 --> 00:03:35,240
Some students want to read.

80
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:37,460
Some students just
want to work on P-sets

81
00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:41,675
and do just-in-time learning,
where they sort of say,

82
00:03:41,675 --> 00:03:42,800
here's what I need to know.

83
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:44,220
Now I'll go look
at the material,

84
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:46,760
just find the worked
example, and if I

85
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:48,380
don't understand
the worked example,

86
00:03:48,380 --> 00:03:51,230
I'll go actually read the text.

87
00:03:51,230 --> 00:03:55,480
So they actually only get to
the beginning of, if you will,

88
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:58,850
the introductory or the
explanatory material only,

89
00:03:58,850 --> 00:04:01,070
and as a last resort
if they somehow

90
00:04:01,070 --> 00:04:02,990
didn't pick it up from before.

91
00:04:02,990 --> 00:04:03,110
SARAH HANSEN:
That's interesting.

92
00:04:03,110 --> 00:04:05,690
CHRISTOPHER TERMAN: So many
different learning styles,

93
00:04:05,690 --> 00:04:07,580
many different backgrounds.

94
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:13,850
SARAH HANSEN: How has the MITx
Residential platform enabled

95
00:04:13,850 --> 00:04:17,131
you to provide this buffet?

96
00:04:17,131 --> 00:04:18,589
CHRISTOPHER TERMAN:
Well, one, it's

97
00:04:18,589 --> 00:04:21,920
a one-stop shop for all the
different sorts of materials.

98
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:25,310
And the other is there's sort
of an emerging best practice

99
00:04:25,310 --> 00:04:30,260
about how to explain material
to people for the first time.

100
00:04:30,260 --> 00:04:34,760
So you want to do short bites;
sound bites, video bites.

101
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:36,800
You know, those short
segments of learning

102
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:40,280
where you introduce a single
skill or a single concept.

103
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:43,580
And then you take a moment
to actually give them

104
00:04:43,580 --> 00:04:46,370
some check yourself questions.

105
00:04:46,370 --> 00:04:49,370
So the idea is in theory
you just listened to this

106
00:04:49,370 --> 00:04:50,760
or watched it.

107
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:53,310
I'm going to ask you some
simple questions, not puzzlers.

108
00:04:53,310 --> 00:04:55,460
They're just if you
understood what I just

109
00:04:55,460 --> 00:04:58,310
told you on the video,
then you can answer them.

110
00:04:58,310 --> 00:05:00,620
And so that gives
those students a chance

111
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:03,440
to start the process
of retrieval learning,

112
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:05,920
where you keep coming
back again and again.

113
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:08,950
And I'll ask you a similar sort
of question two segments later.

114
00:05:08,950 --> 00:05:11,128
And pretty soon,
you're pulling it out

115
00:05:11,128 --> 00:05:13,420
of your short-term, and then
medium-term, and long-term

116
00:05:13,420 --> 00:05:15,490
memories.

117
00:05:15,490 --> 00:05:20,620
So the MITx platform
works really

118
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:23,680
well at letting you construct
those sort of learning

119
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:24,850
sequences.

120
00:05:24,850 --> 00:05:26,680
And I think the
students appreciate it.

121
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:28,900
Everything is more
and more bite-sized.

122
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:31,000
We both know, as
you can imagine,

123
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:35,080
pushing play on a 50-minute
video and along about minute--

124
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:37,870
well, I'm going to say 37,
but along about minute six,

125
00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:40,007
you're going to be,
all right, maybe I

126
00:05:40,007 --> 00:05:42,090
should check my email while
I'm listening to this.

127
00:05:42,090 --> 00:05:42,600
SARAH HANSEN: Right.

128
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:45,250
CHRISTOPHER TERMAN: It's
keeping things short and sweet.

129
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:46,890
So you have a huge--

130
00:05:46,890 --> 00:05:49,510
because now you have a
bunch of short bites.

131
00:05:49,510 --> 00:05:52,210
Now, the MITx platform
lets you organize

132
00:05:52,210 --> 00:05:55,390
those with questions that
let you sort of continue

133
00:05:55,390 --> 00:05:56,750
to test your learning.

134
00:05:56,750 --> 00:06:02,140
So it's actually worked out to
be a very nice way of making

135
00:06:02,140 --> 00:06:05,290
a fairly organized tour
through the material

136
00:06:05,290 --> 00:06:09,400
that the students can start,
and stop, and come back to.

137
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:10,570
Plus it's asynchronous.

138
00:06:10,570 --> 00:06:14,770
In other words, they get to
choose their time and place.

139
00:06:14,770 --> 00:06:17,710
And us teachers always
have a fantasy, well,

140
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:19,775
they didn't come to
lecture, so I'm sure at 3:00

141
00:06:19,775 --> 00:06:21,400
in the morning when
they're wide awake,

142
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:22,420
they're actually watching it.

143
00:06:22,420 --> 00:06:23,590
SARAH HANSEN: Of course.

144
00:06:23,590 --> 00:06:24,130
CHRISTOPHER TERMAN:
If you actually

145
00:06:24,130 --> 00:06:26,080
look at the statistics
for the viewing,

146
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:29,560
there's a lot of viewing
that happens in quiz weeks.

147
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:32,120
So a lot of people may
be using it as sort of a,

148
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:37,030
OK, I want the intense,
immersive introduction

149
00:06:37,030 --> 00:06:37,970
to the material.

150
00:06:37,970 --> 00:06:39,115
SARAH HANSEN: Right.

151
00:06:39,115 --> 00:06:41,320
This must be just such
an exciting time for you

152
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:43,750
as someone who's really
interested in the scholarship

153
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:45,167
of teaching and
learning, and then

154
00:06:45,167 --> 00:06:47,650
the emergence of
these digital tools

155
00:06:47,650 --> 00:06:51,160
to enable that learning
through best practices.

156
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:54,978
I can feel your enthusiasm for
kind of the era that we're in.

157
00:06:54,978 --> 00:06:56,020
CHRISTOPHER TERMAN: Yeah.

158
00:06:56,020 --> 00:07:01,030
Well, so much of how us
people-- or those of us who

159
00:07:01,030 --> 00:07:05,830
teach at the university level,
we get handed a piece of chalk

160
00:07:05,830 --> 00:07:08,883
and be told to teach,
unlike the teachers

161
00:07:08,883 --> 00:07:10,300
for your kids in
elementary school

162
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:12,940
who've actually gone through
a program that teaches them

163
00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:13,590
how to teach.

164
00:07:13,590 --> 00:07:16,340
We're just said, here teach.

165
00:07:16,340 --> 00:07:18,070
And so it's all anecdotal.

166
00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:22,090
It's all trying to remember
how people taught you.

167
00:07:22,090 --> 00:07:25,060
Finally, we have the
online courses providing

168
00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:26,950
a real educational laboratory.

169
00:07:26,950 --> 00:07:29,020
We're able to try out
different techniques.

170
00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:32,350
We're able to make fairly
accurate assessments

171
00:07:32,350 --> 00:07:35,380
of how well did that
just work, whether it

172
00:07:35,380 --> 00:07:39,430
was an exercise, or a video
segment, or a design problem.

173
00:07:39,430 --> 00:07:44,080
And so we can actually do
A/B tests in the same cadre.

174
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:47,020
So it's pretty
neat having a lab.

175
00:07:47,020 --> 00:07:49,450
I mean, as a scientist and
engineer, you can say, look,

176
00:07:49,450 --> 00:07:52,670
I know about the hypothesis.

177
00:07:52,670 --> 00:07:55,300
Test it through a
bunch of experiments.

178
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:57,918
We can really do the experiments
with the MITx platform.

179
00:07:57,918 --> 00:07:58,960
And so that's been great.

180
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:00,430
SARAH HANSEN: Yeah,
it's really exciting.

181
00:08:00,430 --> 00:08:01,630
CHRISTOPHER TERMAN: It is.

182
00:08:01,630 --> 00:08:04,870
SARAH HANSEN: Let's talk about
learning in the classroom

183
00:08:04,870 --> 00:08:09,310
and teaching large
lecture classes.

184
00:08:09,310 --> 00:08:13,855
What strategies do you have
for keeping students engaged?

185
00:08:13,855 --> 00:08:15,730
CHRISTOPHER TERMAN:
Well, that's interesting.

186
00:08:15,730 --> 00:08:20,360
Because we have so many
different materials,

187
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:22,360
really the only students
who come to lecture

188
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:25,740
are the ones for whom
lecture is how they learn.

189
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:27,010
And I was such a student.

190
00:08:27,010 --> 00:08:27,940
SARAH HANSEN: I see.

191
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:30,820
CHRISTOPHER TERMAN:
So the people

192
00:08:30,820 --> 00:08:34,480
who are there are
not a draft army.

193
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:35,534
They're all volunteers.

194
00:08:35,534 --> 00:08:37,380
SARAH HANSEN: Self-selected.

195
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:40,600
CHRISTOPHER TERMAN: So they're
prepared to be somewhat engaged

196
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:41,867
by a vocal presentation.

197
00:08:41,867 --> 00:08:42,700
SARAH HANSEN: I see.

198
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:47,290
CHRISTOPHER TERMAN: So I have a
well-developed set of materials

199
00:08:47,290 --> 00:08:49,240
that I present in
class that have

200
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:53,140
sort of been debugged for having
not too much or too little.

201
00:08:53,140 --> 00:08:56,680
A progression that
most people can follow.

202
00:08:56,680 --> 00:09:00,340
And then happily, when
you teach for a while,

203
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:01,960
you start to get more relaxed.

204
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:05,260
And so it's a very relaxed
sort of experience.

205
00:09:05,260 --> 00:09:05,980
I tell jokes.

206
00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:07,960
I tell stories from my career.

207
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:11,260
And it's interesting to me how
when the students are making

208
00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:14,320
comments at the end of the
semester on the evaluations,

209
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:16,840
many of them say, I
really liked the stories.

210
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:17,923
SARAH HANSEN: Interesting.

211
00:09:17,923 --> 00:09:19,750
CHRISTOPHER TERMAN:
So after boring you

212
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:21,580
with technical details,
it's fun to say,

213
00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:23,410
and then when I
tried to use that,

214
00:09:23,410 --> 00:09:25,650
this following thing happened.

215
00:09:25,650 --> 00:09:28,390
And all of a sudden, they're
sort of perking up, saying, oh.

216
00:09:28,390 --> 00:09:30,580
SARAH HANSEN: And I think it
helps them remember the related

217
00:09:30,580 --> 00:09:30,970
content, too.

218
00:09:30,970 --> 00:09:31,600
CHRISTOPHER TERMAN: It does.

219
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:32,100
It does.

220
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:34,690
When you think about what
you remember from lectures,

221
00:09:34,690 --> 00:09:36,790
it's almost never
a technical nugget.

222
00:09:36,790 --> 00:09:40,480
It's a joke they told, or
an accident that happened,

223
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:41,700
or a mistake that was made.

224
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:41,990
SARAH HANSEN: Right.

225
00:09:41,990 --> 00:09:43,750
CHRISTOPHER TERMAN:
And so it's--

226
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:47,090
there's this concept
called fluency,

227
00:09:47,090 --> 00:09:50,640
which is basically how
smoothly things are going,

228
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:53,190
and everybody's nodding.

229
00:09:53,190 --> 00:09:56,080
So your mind is starting to
drift, because it's all--

230
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:59,140
so it's actually good to try
to put a little disfluency

231
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:02,232
into your lecture, to
actually have a-- you stop,

232
00:10:02,232 --> 00:10:03,407
and you tell a joke.

233
00:10:03,407 --> 00:10:04,240
SARAH HANSEN: Right.

234
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:05,990
CHRISTOPHER TERMAN:
Or you make a mistake,

235
00:10:05,990 --> 00:10:08,020
or you drop the
chalk, and say, darn,

236
00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:09,190
and you look at the floor.

237
00:10:09,190 --> 00:10:10,600
SARAH HANSEN: Right.

238
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:12,058
CHRISTOPHER TERMAN:
And here's what

239
00:10:12,058 --> 00:10:14,320
I like to do is you walk
out from behind the lecture

240
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:17,880
table or lectern, and you
approach the audience.

241
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:22,340
And you can see them sort of
going, wait, he's escaped.

242
00:10:22,340 --> 00:10:26,530
So just anything that sort of
switches up the sort of I'm

243
00:10:26,530 --> 00:10:28,300
just going along
with the flow here.

244
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:33,160
So making little flows that
have things that change

245
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:36,700
make a lot of difference in
keeping people sort of engaged.

246
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:39,280
SARAH HANSEN:
That's a great tip.

247
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:42,640
Let's talk for a second
about the teaching team.

248
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:44,530
I understand there
are a fair number

249
00:10:44,530 --> 00:10:48,040
of people involved in developing
and teaching this course.

250
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:49,240
Could you talk about that?

251
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:51,240
CHRISTOPHER TERMAN: Well,
we have a little cadre

252
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:53,650
of people who are instructors.

253
00:10:53,650 --> 00:10:56,440
I've been sort of part of
that cadre every semester

254
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:58,120
for a very long time.

255
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:01,180
But we have other people who
come in from the outside.

256
00:11:01,180 --> 00:11:05,710
In recent years, the department
has added lecturer resources.

257
00:11:05,710 --> 00:11:08,770
So there's another lecturer
associated with it.

258
00:11:08,770 --> 00:11:10,780
And then faculty come in.

259
00:11:10,780 --> 00:11:12,898
And they provide a little
depth to the gene pool.

260
00:11:12,898 --> 00:11:13,690
SARAH HANSEN: Sure.

261
00:11:13,690 --> 00:11:15,880
CHRISTOPHER TERMAN: But
then we have graduate TAs

262
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:17,350
who teach recitations.

263
00:11:17,350 --> 00:11:23,170
And we have student
undergraduate TAs, and then

264
00:11:23,170 --> 00:11:23,920
lab assistants.

265
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:25,930
So sort of we have
this whole hierarchy.

266
00:11:25,930 --> 00:11:27,790
They've all taken the course.

267
00:11:27,790 --> 00:11:29,860
Almost, they've all loved it.

268
00:11:29,860 --> 00:11:32,770
So I mean, it's sort of the
material that people say,

269
00:11:32,770 --> 00:11:34,330
oh, this is really pretty neat.

270
00:11:34,330 --> 00:11:36,400
I can't wait to tell the next
person about how this works.

271
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:37,233
SARAH HANSEN: Right.

272
00:11:37,233 --> 00:11:40,900
CHRISTOPHER TERMAN: And so
as they sit there and work

273
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:43,990
with the students,
sort of like me,

274
00:11:43,990 --> 00:11:46,000
there's an enthusiasm
that sort of bubbles out.

275
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,330
SARAH HANSEN: It's contagious.

276
00:11:47,330 --> 00:11:48,460
CHRISTOPHER TERMAN: Yeah.

277
00:11:48,460 --> 00:11:50,470
And the students actually--

278
00:11:50,470 --> 00:11:52,900
I sort of listed
things sort of--

279
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:54,360
well, I was going
to say top down.

280
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:57,290
I'm not sure lecturers
are at the top

281
00:11:57,290 --> 00:11:59,288
or instructors are at the top.

282
00:11:59,288 --> 00:12:01,330
But the students actually
prefer the other thing,

283
00:12:01,330 --> 00:12:06,590
which is actually asking an
LA is not very intimidating.

284
00:12:06,590 --> 00:12:09,250
The students, maybe they
just took it last semester.

285
00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:11,170
And so they have it
fresh in their minds

286
00:12:11,170 --> 00:12:15,100
what it is they needed to
do in order to get whatever

287
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:17,410
it is they're trying to get.

288
00:12:17,410 --> 00:12:19,720
And then you sort of
work the chain up,

289
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:25,930
work up the hierarchy to get
an answer of people below.

290
00:12:25,930 --> 00:12:27,940
And that way you're
only asking questions

291
00:12:27,940 --> 00:12:30,700
of the more
intimidating people when

292
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:33,140
you're pretty sure that no
one else has the answer.

293
00:12:33,140 --> 00:12:36,340
So it's really-- by the time
the questions sort of get to me,

294
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:40,690
mostly no one is worried
that they're a dumb question.

295
00:12:40,690 --> 00:12:43,093
Now, I don't really
believe in dumb questions.

296
00:12:43,093 --> 00:12:45,010
I think all questions
are sort of interesting.

297
00:12:45,010 --> 00:12:49,000
But I think the students
are, look, I asked 10 people.

298
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,250
None of us knew, so
now we can ask you.

299
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:54,970
And I'm pretty confident that
it wasn't an obvious thing

300
00:12:54,970 --> 00:12:59,410
that if I only read the
assignment I would have known.

301
00:12:59,410 --> 00:13:04,120
So that sort of range of sort
of experience level and age,

302
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:06,310
at the high end of
the experience level,

303
00:13:06,310 --> 00:13:07,900
you can get an answer
to any question.

304
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:09,880
At the beginning end of
the experience level,

305
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:11,220
you're talking to somebody who--

306
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:12,660
SARAH HANSEN: Just
had that experience

307
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:15,077
CHRISTOPHER TERMAN: Just months
ago did what you're doing.

308
00:13:15,077 --> 00:13:16,660
And so we can be--

309
00:13:16,660 --> 00:13:19,120
I can ask you, and we
won't be embarrassed.

310
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:20,890
SARAH HANSEN: Right, right.

311
00:13:20,890 --> 00:13:23,490
What's the role
of the online fora

312
00:13:23,490 --> 00:13:25,570
in the course for
helping students feel

313
00:13:25,570 --> 00:13:27,220
comfortable asking questions?

314
00:13:27,220 --> 00:13:29,320
And how do you monitor it?

315
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:30,930
How do you run it productively?

316
00:13:30,930 --> 00:13:34,990
This is something that educators
sometimes struggle with.

317
00:13:34,990 --> 00:13:38,050
CHRISTOPHER TERMAN:
Well, I mean, to me,

318
00:13:38,050 --> 00:13:39,400
it's a wonderful asset.

319
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:42,670
For the first time I'm able
to make a thoughtful answer

320
00:13:42,670 --> 00:13:45,370
to a question and
have 180 people look

321
00:13:45,370 --> 00:13:46,770
at the answer instead of one.

322
00:13:46,770 --> 00:13:49,270
And then the next person who
has the same question, you say,

323
00:13:49,270 --> 00:13:52,270
well, I just spent 10 minutes.

324
00:13:52,270 --> 00:13:55,120
And with a large class,
you can't spend 10 minutes

325
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:57,930
for each of 300 people.

326
00:13:57,930 --> 00:14:00,670
So it's a great place
to ask questions.

327
00:14:00,670 --> 00:14:03,610
I try to always give a
thoughtful and respectful

328
00:14:03,610 --> 00:14:06,400
answer to each question.

329
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:08,200
So even if the question
is sort of like,

330
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:10,900
well, if you had done the
reading, you would known,

331
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:13,570
I say, well, if you look
back at the material,

332
00:14:13,570 --> 00:14:16,510
you'll see it explains
the following.

333
00:14:16,510 --> 00:14:18,070
Try to make it not--

334
00:14:18,070 --> 00:14:22,010
a little hint that maybe a
little bit more preparation.

335
00:14:22,010 --> 00:14:24,498
But many of the questions are,
look, I read the material.

336
00:14:24,498 --> 00:14:25,540
I'm still not getting it.

337
00:14:25,540 --> 00:14:28,430
I need an example.

338
00:14:28,430 --> 00:14:30,430
And so the students,
I try to make students

339
00:14:30,430 --> 00:14:31,802
feel very comfortable asking.

340
00:14:31,802 --> 00:14:33,010
It's never-- there's nothing.

341
00:14:33,010 --> 00:14:33,760
No cost.

342
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:35,410
They can ask
anonymously, so that

343
00:14:35,410 --> 00:14:36,730
removes some of the barrier.

344
00:14:36,730 --> 00:14:37,900
SARAH HANSEN: OK.

345
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:40,555
CHRISTOPHER TERMAN: And
then I think-- let's see.

346
00:14:40,555 --> 00:14:45,340
In the fall of 2017, we had
about 2,500 contributions

347
00:14:45,340 --> 00:14:46,050
to the forum.

348
00:14:46,050 --> 00:14:46,445
SARAH HANSEN: Wow.

349
00:14:46,445 --> 00:14:46,840
OK.

350
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:48,715
CHRISTOPHER TERMAN: The
average response time

351
00:14:48,715 --> 00:14:50,800
is about 20 minutes.

352
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:54,160
And so you say, wait, but
students are asking questions

353
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:56,200
at 3:00 AM.

354
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:57,280
How does that work?

355
00:14:57,280 --> 00:15:01,090
And it turns out
that we have TAs.

356
00:15:01,090 --> 00:15:03,053
We particularly have
some really good--

357
00:15:03,053 --> 00:15:04,220
SARAH HANSEN: Nocturnal TAs.

358
00:15:04,220 --> 00:15:05,800
CHRISTOPHER TERMAN:
Yes, exactly.

359
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:08,610
At 3:00 AM they're just
hitting their stride.

360
00:15:08,610 --> 00:15:10,360
A lot of us who are
involved in the course

361
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:13,090
sort of have-- we
put the notification

362
00:15:13,090 --> 00:15:15,010
of postings on real time.

363
00:15:15,010 --> 00:15:17,170
And so we get an
email right away.

364
00:15:17,170 --> 00:15:21,490
And so often we can
just type in an answer.

365
00:15:21,490 --> 00:15:22,270
And it's--

366
00:15:22,270 --> 00:15:23,170
SARAH HANSEN: OK.

367
00:15:23,170 --> 00:15:25,120
CHRISTOPHER TERMAN:
And I'm really--

368
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:28,463
I think the fast response time
really reduces the frustration

369
00:15:28,463 --> 00:15:29,380
level of the students.

370
00:15:29,380 --> 00:15:29,800
SARAH HANSEN: Ah.

371
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:30,310
CHRISTOPHER TERMAN:
There's nothing

372
00:15:30,310 --> 00:15:31,717
like being stuck on something.

373
00:15:31,717 --> 00:15:32,550
SARAH HANSEN: Right.

374
00:15:32,550 --> 00:15:35,320
CHRISTOPHER TERMAN: And say,
I wish I could ask somebody.

375
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:38,800
Well, for the first time,
it's 3:12 in the morning.

376
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:43,130
And you can say, wait, I can
ask, and I can get an answer.

377
00:15:43,130 --> 00:15:46,300
And the students really,
really appreciate that.

378
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:48,760
So the forum has
really, I think,

379
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:54,700
changed students'
level of frustration

380
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:56,860
when they get stuck.

381
00:15:56,860 --> 00:16:00,977
Being stuck is just a 10-minute
process, not a two-day process.

382
00:16:00,977 --> 00:16:01,810
SARAH HANSEN: Right.

383
00:16:01,810 --> 00:16:03,220
CHRISTOPHER TERMAN: My
god, the next office hours

384
00:16:03,220 --> 00:16:04,137
are after the weekend.

385
00:16:04,137 --> 00:16:05,610
What do I do?

386
00:16:05,610 --> 00:16:08,770
And of course, a lot of
students are doing work outside

387
00:16:08,770 --> 00:16:10,960
of sort of 9:00 to 5:00 hours.

388
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:15,460
So it's a way for the staff to
be a 24/7 staff instead of just

389
00:16:15,460 --> 00:16:18,730
a 9:00 to 5:00, five
days a week staff.

390
00:16:18,730 --> 00:16:22,120
The staff like-- and then the
students work like that, too.

391
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:25,270
Most of the people who
are helping on the forum

392
00:16:25,270 --> 00:16:27,940
are keeping the same schedule
as the users of the forum.

393
00:16:27,940 --> 00:16:30,120
So it's a good match.

394
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:31,630
SARAH HANSEN: OK.

395
00:16:31,630 --> 00:16:33,760
Let's talk for a
minute about the lab

396
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:36,520
experiences in the course.

397
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:39,100
So students get
hands-on experience

398
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:40,620
doing digital design.

399
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:41,620
CHRISTOPHER TERMAN: Yes.

400
00:16:41,620 --> 00:16:43,330
SARAH HANSEN: Could
you talk about a few

401
00:16:43,330 --> 00:16:44,410
of those experiences?

402
00:16:44,410 --> 00:16:47,770
And also, does that take place
here where we are right now?

403
00:16:47,770 --> 00:16:48,800
CHRISTOPHER TERMAN: Well,
you can do it anywhere.

404
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:49,640
It's browser-based.

405
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:51,140
So there's no
software to download.

406
00:16:51,140 --> 00:16:51,880
It's just on the web.

407
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:52,380
You go.

408
00:16:52,380 --> 00:16:53,810
SARAH HANSEN: I see.

409
00:16:53,810 --> 00:16:55,643
CHRISTOPHER TERMAN: And
so one of the things

410
00:16:55,643 --> 00:16:58,600
I enjoy doing is to build
browser-based computer-aided

411
00:16:58,600 --> 00:16:59,570
design tools.

412
00:16:59,570 --> 00:17:02,260
It turns out that they
actually work really well.

413
00:17:02,260 --> 00:17:03,850
The modern browser
environments are

414
00:17:03,850 --> 00:17:07,470
quite capable as a
programming environment.

415
00:17:07,470 --> 00:17:10,300
You have to learn a few tricks,
but once you do, it works well.

416
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:13,450
So they're reasonably
high-performing tools.

417
00:17:13,450 --> 00:17:15,819
They can sit down and do.

418
00:17:15,819 --> 00:17:20,140
Much of the design work we do is
sort of design-driven learning,

419
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:22,599
where we're actually trying
to get them to build something

420
00:17:22,599 --> 00:17:23,474
that we've described.

421
00:17:23,474 --> 00:17:24,550
SARAH HANSEN: I see.

422
00:17:24,550 --> 00:17:26,633
CHRISTOPHER TERMAN: And
we may have even told them

423
00:17:26,633 --> 00:17:28,630
in quite some detail
how it fits together,

424
00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:31,270
but there's something about
the old muscle memory bit

425
00:17:31,270 --> 00:17:33,970
about if you actually
build it yourself, drag

426
00:17:33,970 --> 00:17:36,860
the components on
and wire them up,

427
00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:38,620
you'll remember it much better.

428
00:17:38,620 --> 00:17:41,897
Or you'll ask yourself, wait,
does this go here or here?

429
00:17:41,897 --> 00:17:43,480
And then you say--
then you look back,

430
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:45,580
and you're starting
to say, I'm looking

431
00:17:45,580 --> 00:17:47,680
at this diagram,
the instructions,

432
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:50,860
for the first time with enough
care to appreciate that,

433
00:17:50,860 --> 00:17:53,860
oh, I have to put it this
way in order for it to work.

434
00:17:53,860 --> 00:17:57,460
And so we're sort of--

435
00:17:57,460 --> 00:18:00,220
hand and eye are engaged.

436
00:18:00,220 --> 00:18:03,890
It's not just a
listening experience.

437
00:18:03,890 --> 00:18:06,160
We are able to-- if
you assemble something,

438
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:09,400
we build tests to see if
it functions correctly.

439
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:13,033
And so you can tell right away
whether you've screwed it up.

440
00:18:13,033 --> 00:18:16,170
It's not like, well, I turn
it in, and a week later--

441
00:18:16,170 --> 00:18:18,740
long past when I've
ceased to care--

442
00:18:18,740 --> 00:18:22,560
I get back a red X. And
I say, OK, well, dang.

443
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:26,130
So here they have to get it
right in order to complete it,

444
00:18:26,130 --> 00:18:28,503
but we tell them right
away that it's not right.

445
00:18:28,503 --> 00:18:29,670
And they keep working on it.

446
00:18:29,670 --> 00:18:31,900
Or they post on Piazza.

447
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:33,510
My circuit doesn't work.

448
00:18:33,510 --> 00:18:36,030
The staff can pull it up
remotely from the server,

449
00:18:36,030 --> 00:18:39,900
and say, oh, here's where--
here's your mistake.

450
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:43,800
So the idea is that the students
are actually being engineers.

451
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:48,360
This may be one of the first
actual build-it experiences

452
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:49,590
they have.

453
00:18:49,590 --> 00:18:52,760
Again, these are
sophomores, right?

454
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:55,295
So it's a little bit
of fun to say, well,

455
00:18:55,295 --> 00:18:56,170
this is sort of neat.

456
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:02,610
I've actually put together
the circuit and debugged it.

457
00:19:02,610 --> 00:19:04,230
So I had to say,
well, what was wrong?

458
00:19:04,230 --> 00:19:05,130
I got a wrong thing.

459
00:19:05,130 --> 00:19:06,330
What did I do wrong?

460
00:19:06,330 --> 00:19:07,630
And then fix it.

461
00:19:07,630 --> 00:19:10,080
So that's a very
valuable experience.

462
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:11,940
So it's one thing.

463
00:19:11,940 --> 00:19:14,320
It's like the late
night TV salesman.

464
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:15,600
When you watch them, use it.

465
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:16,560
It's so easy.

466
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:17,440
SARAH HANSEN: Right.

467
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:19,440
CHRISTOPHER TERMAN: But
you get the widget home.

468
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:20,677
And it doesn't work.

469
00:19:20,677 --> 00:19:22,510
And so that's-- they've
seen it in lectures.

470
00:19:22,510 --> 00:19:23,880
They've seen it on the videos.

471
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:26,640
They've seen it the
worked examples.

472
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:30,180
And it's all extremely obvious
that this is straightforward

473
00:19:30,180 --> 00:19:31,410
until you do it yourself.

474
00:19:31,410 --> 00:19:33,030
And then you fill
in all the pieces,

475
00:19:33,030 --> 00:19:37,110
that you were just being,
oh, how hard could that be?

476
00:19:37,110 --> 00:19:38,207
Oh, now I know.

477
00:19:38,207 --> 00:19:39,040
SARAH HANSEN: Right.

478
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:41,540
CHRISTOPHER TERMAN: So they
work hard at trying to fix that.

479
00:19:41,540 --> 00:19:43,980
And I think the whole idea
of these virtual lab benches

480
00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:46,740
is great.

481
00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:49,290
As I said, the
execution environment

482
00:19:49,290 --> 00:19:52,890
and the graphics environment
on the browser is first rate.

483
00:19:52,890 --> 00:19:56,250
It's very easy to build
sophisticated tools that

484
00:19:56,250 --> 00:20:00,340
use reasonably complex
calculations in the background

485
00:20:00,340 --> 00:20:03,810
and have a really
great user interface.

486
00:20:03,810 --> 00:20:06,920
And the browser is portable.

487
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:09,270
So 20 years ago I
gave you software

488
00:20:09,270 --> 00:20:12,760
to download on your
computer to do this stuff.

489
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:13,890
The landmine that was.

490
00:20:13,890 --> 00:20:15,580
Everybody's environment
was a little different.

491
00:20:15,580 --> 00:20:17,540
Oh, you don't have the latest
version of that library?

492
00:20:17,540 --> 00:20:18,582
Well, you can't run this.

493
00:20:18,582 --> 00:20:22,080
But if you update your
library, you can't run that.

494
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:23,920
It was really a nightmare.

495
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:29,280
So packaging things--
packaging up these lab

496
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:31,320
experiences in a way
that they can be used

497
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:34,590
by people around the world.

498
00:20:34,590 --> 00:20:35,370
So here I was.

499
00:20:35,370 --> 00:20:38,940
I was riding on the
Hong Kong subway.

500
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:43,510
And some young adult
comes up to me and says,

501
00:20:43,510 --> 00:20:44,575
I took your MITx course.

502
00:20:44,575 --> 00:20:45,450
SARAH HANSEN: Really?

503
00:20:45,450 --> 00:20:47,490
CHRISTOPHER TERMAN: And I really
loved doing the circuit stuff.

504
00:20:47,490 --> 00:20:49,115
And I didn't have to
download anything.

505
00:20:49,115 --> 00:20:50,700
And I'm sort of going, wow.

506
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:51,510
I mean, this is--

507
00:20:51,510 --> 00:20:52,760
SARAH HANSEN: It's incredible.

508
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:53,843
CHRISTOPHER TERMAN: It is.

509
00:20:53,843 --> 00:20:55,960
It's interesting to
be stopped by people.

510
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:56,793
SARAH HANSEN: Right.

511
00:20:56,793 --> 00:20:58,210
CHRISTOPHER TERMAN:
And they start

512
00:20:58,210 --> 00:21:00,900
talking about how this was
more than just a listening

513
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:01,440
experience.

514
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:07,320
So these virtual labs actually
go from being something that--

515
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:09,510
I mean, it takes courses
from being a listening

516
00:21:09,510 --> 00:21:15,030
experience with maybe some
pencil P-sets to your hands

517
00:21:15,030 --> 00:21:16,200
are active.

518
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:18,780
So hands-on, brain on, right?

519
00:21:18,780 --> 00:21:22,720
And when people's brains
turn on, it's amazing what--

520
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:23,970
they remember it.

521
00:21:23,970 --> 00:21:26,600
SARAH HANSEN: Right.

522
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:29,300
So what kind of
challenges do students

523
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:33,050
encounter when they're trying
their hand at being engineers

524
00:21:33,050 --> 00:21:35,240
for the first time?

525
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:38,030
Is there anything that tends
to pop up again and again?

526
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:44,300
CHRISTOPHER TERMAN: So
I think a lot of this

527
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:46,980
is sort of competence.

528
00:21:46,980 --> 00:21:52,988
So people sometimes-- the
students come to me, and say,

529
00:21:52,988 --> 00:21:54,030
I want to make this work.

530
00:21:54,030 --> 00:21:56,180
And I say, OK, let me
look at your design.

531
00:21:56,180 --> 00:21:57,230
Let's fix it.

532
00:21:57,230 --> 00:21:58,010
And I go through.

533
00:21:58,010 --> 00:22:01,490
And I try to keep my
hands in my pockets

534
00:22:01,490 --> 00:22:02,930
and let them do the fixing.

535
00:22:02,930 --> 00:22:05,100
But I say, have you
thought about this?

536
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:07,790
If this works and that doesn't,
what does that tell you?

537
00:22:07,790 --> 00:22:11,090
So a lot of students
aren't very good at taking

538
00:22:11,090 --> 00:22:13,460
the information they
do know and using

539
00:22:13,460 --> 00:22:15,720
it to deduce the
next thing to try

540
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:18,080
or the next thing to
test and to narrow down

541
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:19,310
where the problem is.

542
00:22:19,310 --> 00:22:21,140
So there's a real--
there's a learning--

543
00:22:21,140 --> 00:22:24,050
something you have to learn how
to do is to be organized about

544
00:22:24,050 --> 00:22:28,710
how taking something
that isn't working--

545
00:22:28,710 --> 00:22:30,860
or complicated things, so
parts of it are working,

546
00:22:30,860 --> 00:22:32,150
but something isn't.

547
00:22:32,150 --> 00:22:34,190
And trying to work
back from both

548
00:22:34,190 --> 00:22:36,830
ends to somewhere in the
middle that doesn't work.

549
00:22:36,830 --> 00:22:40,460
And so that's a skill that you
have to practice for a while.

550
00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:43,940
And we try to help
with that skill.

551
00:22:43,940 --> 00:22:46,070
I have a lot of
confidence that will work.

552
00:22:46,070 --> 00:22:48,920
Most students are pretty
convinced that either

553
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:52,075
the simulator is
broken or is hopeless.

554
00:22:52,075 --> 00:22:53,450
And so they're
somewhat surprised

555
00:22:53,450 --> 00:22:56,450
to realize that there
is a systematic way

556
00:22:56,450 --> 00:22:58,100
to make something that works.

557
00:22:58,100 --> 00:23:03,950
And once they are convinced
that that's actually true,

558
00:23:03,950 --> 00:23:06,740
they are getting more confident
that, oh, it doesn't work now,

559
00:23:06,740 --> 00:23:09,890
but I'll just work on it for 10
minutes, and I'm sure it will.

560
00:23:09,890 --> 00:23:12,620
As opposed to just saying,
oh, the only thing I can do

561
00:23:12,620 --> 00:23:14,660
is to raise my hand and
say, could you help me?

562
00:23:14,660 --> 00:23:16,160
Because it isn't working.

563
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:17,720
So we try to get
the students out

564
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:20,840
of, look, your job is to
actually make it work,

565
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:24,877
not to merely ask us to come
over and watch us make it work.

566
00:23:24,877 --> 00:23:25,710
SARAH HANSEN: Right.

567
00:23:25,710 --> 00:23:28,628
CHRISTOPHER TERMAN: And so
students make that transition

568
00:23:28,628 --> 00:23:29,420
through the course.

569
00:23:29,420 --> 00:23:30,230
SARAH HANSEN: So it seems--

570
00:23:30,230 --> 00:23:31,500
CHRISTOPHER TERMAN: The
course of the course.

571
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:32,333
SARAH HANSEN: Right.

572
00:23:32,333 --> 00:23:34,310
So it seems like a
learning goal in the course

573
00:23:34,310 --> 00:23:37,050
is not only learning
the architecture

574
00:23:37,050 --> 00:23:40,100
of digital systems,
but also developing

575
00:23:40,100 --> 00:23:43,520
professional competencies
in the sense of attitudes

576
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:44,487
that engineers embrace.

577
00:23:44,487 --> 00:23:45,570
CHRISTOPHER TERMAN: Right.

578
00:23:45,570 --> 00:23:47,840
There's a bunch of processes
that you have to go through.

579
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:48,100
SARAH HANSEN: Processes.

580
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:50,450
CHRISTOPHER TERMAN: And the same
thing is true of all learning.

581
00:23:50,450 --> 00:23:51,980
Learning how to
learn is something

582
00:23:51,980 --> 00:23:54,290
that sophomores are still doing.

583
00:23:54,290 --> 00:23:57,860
And so this is
probably the first time

584
00:23:57,860 --> 00:24:01,520
that they've been sort of
thrown into the deep end.

585
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:04,940
We try to have lots of
lifeguards standing by.

586
00:24:04,940 --> 00:24:07,040
But we're prepared
to do more than just

587
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:09,630
check off on our
clipboard, sink or swim.

588
00:24:09,630 --> 00:24:13,380
I mean, we're ready to dive
in, and say, OK, try this.

589
00:24:13,380 --> 00:24:14,900
Try that.

590
00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:19,760
It's actually pretty helpful
to have an experience like this

591
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:22,610
after your freshman year, which
has a lot of training wheels,

592
00:24:22,610 --> 00:24:24,530
but before your
upper level classes

593
00:24:24,530 --> 00:24:29,020
where help is a little thin.

594
00:24:29,020 --> 00:24:30,830
SARAH HANSEN: Right.

595
00:24:30,830 --> 00:24:33,590
CHRISTOPHER TERMAN: One of the
great things about 004 is that

596
00:24:33,590 --> 00:24:37,170
half the people on your
hall have taken this course.

597
00:24:37,170 --> 00:24:40,250
And so even though we
have our core staff,

598
00:24:40,250 --> 00:24:42,560
you can go down your
hall, and as I say,

599
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:45,230
every other person will
say, oh, I took the course.

600
00:24:45,230 --> 00:24:48,050
So there's actually
an enormous body

601
00:24:48,050 --> 00:24:51,050
of knowledge about the
material and things like that.

602
00:24:51,050 --> 00:24:56,720
So not many courses
have that opportunity,

603
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:58,630
but we take great
advantage of it.

604
00:24:58,630 --> 00:25:01,820
So there's a lot of sort
of hallway learning,

605
00:25:01,820 --> 00:25:03,830
peer learning that
happens outside

606
00:25:03,830 --> 00:25:05,270
of the sort of
structured learning

607
00:25:05,270 --> 00:25:06,565
that we do in the class.

608
00:25:06,565 --> 00:25:07,940
SARAH HANSEN:
That's fascinating.

609
00:25:07,940 --> 00:25:09,560
It kind of speaks
to the importance

610
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:12,140
of having common
learning experiences

611
00:25:12,140 --> 00:25:14,750
at the undergraduate
level just to facilitate

612
00:25:14,750 --> 00:25:17,120
that sort of, like you
said, hallway learning.

613
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:18,200
It's really interesting.

614
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:20,158
CHRISTOPHER TERMAN: Well,
plus students often--

615
00:25:20,158 --> 00:25:21,660
during the day, it's hectic.

616
00:25:21,660 --> 00:25:21,920
SARAH HANSEN: Yes.

617
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:23,300
CHRISTOPHER TERMAN:
They're distracted.

618
00:25:23,300 --> 00:25:24,410
They come to lecture.

619
00:25:24,410 --> 00:25:27,050
They have lots of
things on their minds.

620
00:25:27,050 --> 00:25:30,110
So mostly it's being in
the quiet of their room

621
00:25:30,110 --> 00:25:32,750
that they probably
intellectually really

622
00:25:32,750 --> 00:25:34,190
grapple with the material.

623
00:25:34,190 --> 00:25:38,630
So first of all, giving them
things to grapple with is good,

624
00:25:38,630 --> 00:25:41,600
but then making sure they're
supported, either through peers

625
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:43,970
or through the Piazza forum.

626
00:25:43,970 --> 00:25:47,566
When they're outside of the sort
of structured help we provide.

627
00:25:47,566 --> 00:25:48,520
SARAH HANSEN: Right.

628
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:49,937
CHRISTOPHER TERMAN:
It's really, I

629
00:25:49,937 --> 00:25:52,370
think, changed how the
students consume the course.

630
00:25:52,370 --> 00:25:59,030
And so the lecture
attendance is modest.

631
00:25:59,030 --> 00:26:04,100
But a lot of people do very
well on learning the material

632
00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:04,892
on the assessments.

633
00:26:04,892 --> 00:26:05,725
SARAH HANSEN: Right.

634
00:26:05,725 --> 00:26:07,250
I mean, I think
that speaks to what

635
00:26:07,250 --> 00:26:10,520
you talked about earlier in
that you offer a buffet of ways

636
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:11,240
to learn.

637
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:13,240
And so people who
come to the lectures

638
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:16,967
are the people who learn
best through that format.

639
00:26:16,967 --> 00:26:18,050
CHRISTOPHER TERMAN: Right.

640
00:26:18,050 --> 00:26:20,720
And some people I never see
except occasionally they'll

641
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:22,150
come when I have lab hours.

642
00:26:22,150 --> 00:26:24,650
They'll come by, because they
just want to chit chat, right?

643
00:26:24,650 --> 00:26:25,483
SARAH HANSEN: Right.

644
00:26:25,483 --> 00:26:27,260
CHRISTOPHER TERMAN: We have--

645
00:26:27,260 --> 00:26:29,600
one of the activities you
do after you do the design,

646
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:30,650
we have a check-off.

647
00:26:30,650 --> 00:26:34,850
So you have to come and
sort of explain your design.

648
00:26:34,850 --> 00:26:37,940
Partly that's just to make
sure that maybe you actually

649
00:26:37,940 --> 00:26:40,947
did the design instead of
your friend down the hall.

650
00:26:40,947 --> 00:26:41,780
SARAH HANSEN: I see.

651
00:26:41,780 --> 00:26:43,613
CHRISTOPHER TERMAN: And
so at the very least

652
00:26:43,613 --> 00:26:45,280
we want them to
understand the design

653
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:46,572
that they claim they have done.

654
00:26:46,572 --> 00:26:47,763
SARAH HANSEN: Right.

655
00:26:47,763 --> 00:26:49,180
CHRISTOPHER TERMAN:
But for people

656
00:26:49,180 --> 00:26:51,010
who have worked hard
on it, it's an opp--

657
00:26:51,010 --> 00:26:53,380
they love to come
by and show it off.

658
00:26:53,380 --> 00:26:55,900
And so they're proud
of their baby, right?

659
00:26:55,900 --> 00:26:57,670
I mean, particularly
towards the end

660
00:26:57,670 --> 00:27:01,240
of the course when we have
a fairly complex design

661
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:05,260
project, which is actually very
hard to get very high marks on.

662
00:27:05,260 --> 00:27:07,280
I mean, you have to be
really good to get it.

663
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:11,050
And so it's an amazing number
of people who tackle that.

664
00:27:11,050 --> 00:27:12,160
And they come in.

665
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:14,120
And they say, OK,
I'm stuck here.

666
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:16,210
Give me some ideas
what to try next.

667
00:27:16,210 --> 00:27:20,460
And if you dare try to
say, well, just do this.

668
00:27:20,460 --> 00:27:22,030
I don't want the answer.

669
00:27:22,030 --> 00:27:23,650
I want you to--

670
00:27:23,650 --> 00:27:24,870
I'm having fun here.

671
00:27:24,870 --> 00:27:26,288
So don't take away the fun part.

672
00:27:26,288 --> 00:27:27,580
I want to puzzle it out myself.

673
00:27:27,580 --> 00:27:29,020
I just need some
hints as to where

674
00:27:29,020 --> 00:27:31,445
my puzzler should be focusing.

675
00:27:31,445 --> 00:27:33,070
SARAH HANSEN: The
fun is in the puzzle.

676
00:27:33,070 --> 00:27:34,153
CHRISTOPHER TERMAN: It is.

677
00:27:34,153 --> 00:27:35,410
It is, and the doing of it.

678
00:27:35,410 --> 00:27:37,755
SARAH HANSEN: And
the doing of it.

679
00:27:37,755 --> 00:27:39,630
CHRISTOPHER TERMAN: And
I think that's great,

680
00:27:39,630 --> 00:27:42,180
because when
students first come,

681
00:27:42,180 --> 00:27:44,250
they tend to be
focusing on the answers.

682
00:27:44,250 --> 00:27:47,220
Here you gave me a bunch of--
a worksheet full of questions.

683
00:27:47,220 --> 00:27:49,082
So I looked at the answers.

684
00:27:49,082 --> 00:27:50,040
I think I'm good to go.

685
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:53,190
I say, no, the worksheets aren't
because we want you to know

686
00:27:53,190 --> 00:27:54,510
the answers to those questions.

687
00:27:54,510 --> 00:27:57,840
The worksheets are
to help you diagnose

688
00:27:57,840 --> 00:27:59,933
whether you understand things.

689
00:27:59,933 --> 00:28:02,100
So the best thing that can
happen with the worksheet

690
00:28:02,100 --> 00:28:04,620
is I don't know how
to do this problem.

691
00:28:04,620 --> 00:28:06,720
And so I should go
figure out how to do it.

692
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:12,210
So if you're doing this
self-paced mastery learning

693
00:28:12,210 --> 00:28:17,730
shtick, which is sort of
how we try to help students

694
00:28:17,730 --> 00:28:23,850
master the material at their
own pace, whenever they want to.

695
00:28:23,850 --> 00:28:26,370
So we have to provide a
lot of self-assessments.

696
00:28:26,370 --> 00:28:28,580
They have to use them
as assessments, though.

697
00:28:28,580 --> 00:28:28,920
SARAH HANSEN: Right.

698
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:29,580
CHRISTOPHER TERMAN:
They don't use them

699
00:28:29,580 --> 00:28:30,840
as assessments if
they're just saying,

700
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:32,507
oh, the answer's three
to this question,

701
00:28:32,507 --> 00:28:34,590
and I hope they ask
this one on the quiz.

702
00:28:34,590 --> 00:28:35,797
They're not getting it.

703
00:28:35,797 --> 00:28:36,630
SARAH HANSEN: Right.

704
00:28:36,630 --> 00:28:37,290
CHRISTOPHER TERMAN:
Getting students

705
00:28:37,290 --> 00:28:39,660
to stop focusing on
the answers and really

706
00:28:39,660 --> 00:28:43,177
focus on, how do I tackle
this sort of problem?

707
00:28:43,177 --> 00:28:44,010
SARAH HANSEN: Right.

708
00:28:44,010 --> 00:28:45,210
CHRISTOPHER TERMAN: Of all
the things I know how to do,

709
00:28:45,210 --> 00:28:48,540
I first have to select the
appropriate concept or skill,

710
00:28:48,540 --> 00:28:50,580
and then I have to
know how to apply it.

711
00:28:50,580 --> 00:28:54,300
It's sort of neat to watch them
make the transition from coming

712
00:28:54,300 --> 00:28:58,770
in as sort of answer focused to
leaving sort of like, OK, you

713
00:28:58,770 --> 00:29:00,960
can ask me anything,
because I actually

714
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:02,940
know how to do
things from scratch,

715
00:29:02,940 --> 00:29:08,610
not because I just
could pick something.

716
00:29:08,610 --> 00:29:11,490
I can not only recognize the
right answer when I see it.

717
00:29:11,490 --> 00:29:13,470
I can actually
make right answers.

718
00:29:13,470 --> 00:29:15,810
That's a very--
people feel empowered

719
00:29:15,810 --> 00:29:19,020
when they can do that.

720
00:29:19,020 --> 00:29:21,330
SARAH HANSEN: Let's talk
a bit about the future.

721
00:29:21,330 --> 00:29:24,030
It seems like the courses
is finely tuned already.

722
00:29:24,030 --> 00:29:26,010
But do you have
ideas for how you

723
00:29:26,010 --> 00:29:28,413
might tweak it in the future?

724
00:29:28,413 --> 00:29:30,580
CHRISTOPHER TERMAN: Well,
I'm retiring in two weeks.

725
00:29:30,580 --> 00:29:32,175
SARAH HANSEN: Oh, so not you.

726
00:29:32,175 --> 00:29:34,050
CHRISTOPHER TERMAN: So
it's being turned over

727
00:29:34,050 --> 00:29:34,860
to a new team.

728
00:29:34,860 --> 00:29:37,470
Some of the people who were
part of the teaching cadre

729
00:29:37,470 --> 00:29:40,440
earlier are taking it over.

730
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:42,840
They, of course, have
their own strong opinions

731
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:45,160
about better ways
of doing things.

732
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:47,640
So I think that the basic
structure of the course

733
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:51,270
will be the same, the basic list
of topics that will be taught.

734
00:29:51,270 --> 00:29:54,030
But they have a different sort
of design experience in mind.

735
00:29:54,030 --> 00:29:57,750
So they'll find their own way.

736
00:29:57,750 --> 00:30:00,240
It's interesting to
me because I think

737
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:03,640
until you've taught
a 300-person course,

738
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:06,300
you may not appreciate how
things which work really

739
00:30:06,300 --> 00:30:08,760
well with two students
in your office

740
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:12,420
or 10 students in a
recitation doesn't really

741
00:30:12,420 --> 00:30:14,073
work for 300 students.

742
00:30:14,073 --> 00:30:15,990
You suddenly say, well,
they'll ask a question

743
00:30:15,990 --> 00:30:16,698
if they have one.

744
00:30:16,698 --> 00:30:18,930
So I don't need to
be too specific.

745
00:30:18,930 --> 00:30:22,830
It's sort of interesting to
say, whoa, 300 questions.

746
00:30:22,830 --> 00:30:24,030
That's a lot of questions.

747
00:30:24,030 --> 00:30:25,770
And three of them
from every student.

748
00:30:25,770 --> 00:30:28,060
So I have 1,000
questions this week.

749
00:30:28,060 --> 00:30:31,290
And so you start learning
how carefully the materials

750
00:30:31,290 --> 00:30:32,160
have to be prepared.

751
00:30:34,950 --> 00:30:36,700
In one of the
questions you sent me,

752
00:30:36,700 --> 00:30:40,680
you talked about
engineering the materials.

753
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:44,460
And a big class has a real
issue with engineering materials

754
00:30:44,460 --> 00:30:49,440
that will help get
students to do the things

755
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:53,400
you want them to do, but
you can't leave them adrift,

756
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:56,160
because you only
have so much capacity

757
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:58,350
to pull them all back to shore.

758
00:30:58,350 --> 00:31:00,960
And so you really have
to put most of what

759
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:02,740
they need into the materials.

760
00:31:02,740 --> 00:31:05,220
SARAH HANSEN: Right.

761
00:31:05,220 --> 00:31:08,700
Can you say more about
engineering the materials

762
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:10,838
to keep everyone afloat?

763
00:31:10,838 --> 00:31:13,130
CHRISTOPHER TERMAN: Well, so
it's an iterative process.

764
00:31:13,130 --> 00:31:17,570
I mean, people say, oh,
004, it runs like clockwork.

765
00:31:17,570 --> 00:31:19,700
This is the best organized
course I've ever had.

766
00:31:19,700 --> 00:31:24,500
And I say, well, 20 years ago
you wouldn't have said that.

767
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:26,875
We've had our share of
unfortunate assignments,

768
00:31:26,875 --> 00:31:29,150
or undoable assignments,
or assignments

769
00:31:29,150 --> 00:31:32,270
that were just too hard for
some students, or too easy

770
00:31:32,270 --> 00:31:33,380
for everybody.

771
00:31:33,380 --> 00:31:35,540
And so yes, we do that.

772
00:31:35,540 --> 00:31:38,708
We try to get student feedback.

773
00:31:38,708 --> 00:31:40,250
The forum is actually
great for that.

774
00:31:40,250 --> 00:31:42,180
You get instant feedback on--

775
00:31:42,180 --> 00:31:42,680
this sucked.

776
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:45,700
And you're going, OK, OK.

777
00:31:45,700 --> 00:31:47,630
And so if you're
good, you make notes.

778
00:31:47,630 --> 00:31:48,467
SARAH HANSEN: OK.

779
00:31:48,467 --> 00:31:50,675
CHRISTOPHER TERMAN: I think
I've taught this course--

780
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:55,100
I don't know--

781
00:31:55,100 --> 00:31:55,880
30 semesters.

782
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:56,630
SARAH HANSEN: Wow.

783
00:31:56,630 --> 00:31:59,047
CHRISTOPHER TERMAN: So that
gives you a lot of opportunity

784
00:31:59,047 --> 00:32:00,153
to think--

785
00:32:00,153 --> 00:32:02,070
reflect at the end of
each semester about what

786
00:32:02,070 --> 00:32:03,600
went right, what went wrong.

787
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:06,300
With a good staff, they're
usually on top of it.

788
00:32:06,300 --> 00:32:09,810
Oh, we've got to change this,
or I spent too much time

789
00:32:09,810 --> 00:32:11,660
helping students with this.

790
00:32:11,660 --> 00:32:14,490
And even in real-time
we'll add a paragraph

791
00:32:14,490 --> 00:32:18,180
to the assignment saying, oh,
a little bit more explanation,

792
00:32:18,180 --> 00:32:19,027
or a hint.

793
00:32:19,027 --> 00:32:19,860
SARAH HANSEN: Right.

794
00:32:19,860 --> 00:32:24,110
CHRISTOPHER TERMAN: So a
willingness to sort of--

795
00:32:24,110 --> 00:32:26,070
and think of building
the materials

796
00:32:26,070 --> 00:32:28,630
as a continuous process.

797
00:32:28,630 --> 00:32:32,000
And after a while, most of
the potholes are filled in,

798
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,850
and the drive is pretty smooth.

799
00:32:33,850 --> 00:32:35,795
SARAH HANSEN: Right.

800
00:32:35,795 --> 00:32:37,170
CHRISTOPHER TERMAN:
And sometimes

801
00:32:37,170 --> 00:32:40,830
the unexpected problem
is actually a doorway

802
00:32:40,830 --> 00:32:43,800
actually into a whole new thing.

803
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:46,440
We have some students that
say, I thought about this,

804
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:47,730
and I tried doing it this way.

805
00:32:47,730 --> 00:32:50,850
And I'm going, whoa, what
a great insight that is.

806
00:32:50,850 --> 00:32:53,710
And so we want all the students
to have that opportunity.

807
00:32:53,710 --> 00:32:55,210
So now we're going
to figure out how

808
00:32:55,210 --> 00:32:57,990
to build that into
the design problem

809
00:32:57,990 --> 00:33:01,820
so that everybody has an
opportunity to go aha.

810
00:33:01,820 --> 00:33:04,170
And it was really
neat that the students

811
00:33:04,170 --> 00:33:06,570
were able to come up
with that themselves.

812
00:33:06,570 --> 00:33:12,070
But that gives you a viewpoint.

813
00:33:12,070 --> 00:33:15,510
It gives you an opportunity
to understand how students

814
00:33:15,510 --> 00:33:17,670
are seeing what you're asking.

815
00:33:17,670 --> 00:33:20,170
They misunderstood, so they
answered a different question.

816
00:33:20,170 --> 00:33:23,470
And it turns out that
different question was at least

817
00:33:23,470 --> 00:33:26,170
as interesting, or maybe even
better than the one you asked.

818
00:33:26,170 --> 00:33:30,500
And so then you start one
of these virtual cycles.

819
00:33:30,500 --> 00:33:33,730
Then slowly you
build up stuff where

820
00:33:33,730 --> 00:33:37,480
you end up with questions
that are really--

821
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:40,550
they don't look like
there's much to them,

822
00:33:40,550 --> 00:33:42,640
but there's been
a lot of evolution

823
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:45,070
behind asking it just this way.

824
00:33:45,070 --> 00:33:46,270
SARAH HANSEN: Interesting.

825
00:33:46,270 --> 00:33:48,640
CHRISTOPHER TERMAN:
And just this order.

826
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:51,220
So it's been fun to go
through that experience,

827
00:33:51,220 --> 00:33:52,630
and often surprising.

828
00:33:52,630 --> 00:33:55,773
And we go, oh, I
thought it was so clear.
