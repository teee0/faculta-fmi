00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.960
Using a D register as
the memory component

00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:05.695
in our sequential logic
system works great!

00:00:05.695 --> 00:00:07.070
At each rising
edge of the clock,

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:08.880
the register loads
the new state,

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:11.280
which then appears at
the register’s output

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:15.070
as the current state for the
rest of the clock period.

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:18.000
The combinational logic uses
the current state and the value

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.020
of the inputs to calculate
the next state and the values

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:23.450
for the outputs.

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:25.960
A sequence of rising
clock edges and inputs

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:28.670
will produce a sequence
of states, which

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:31.360
leads to a sequence of outputs.

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:34.160
In the next chapter we’ll
introduce a new abstraction,

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:37.260
finite state machines, that
will make it easy to design

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.490
sequential logic systems.

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:42.370
Let’s use the timing analysis
techniques we’ve learned

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:46.070
on the sequential logic
system shown here.

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:49.100
The timing specifications for
the register and combinational

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:51.150
logic are as shown.

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:54.240
Here are the questions
we need to answer.

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:57.020
The contamination delay of
the combinational logic isn’t

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:58.590
specified.

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:00.780
What does it have to be
in order for the system

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.790
to work correctly?

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:05.860
Well, we know that the
sum of register and logic

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:08.290
contamination delays
has to be greater

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:11.080
than or equal to the hold
time of the register.

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:13.750
Using the timing
parameters we do know along

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:15.520
with a little
arithmetic tells us

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:17.660
that the contamination
delay of the logic

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:21.700
has to be at least 1ns.

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:24.360
What is the minimum value
for the clock period tCLK?

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:28.280
The second timing inequality
from the previous section

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:30.430
tells us that tCLK
has be greater

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:33.530
than than the sum of the
register and logic propagation

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:37.140
delays plus the setup
time of the register.

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.310
Using the known values
for these parameters

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:41.560
gives us a minimum
clock period of 10ns.

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:47.030
What are the timing constraints
for the Input signal

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:50.460
relative to the rising
edge of the clock?

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:53.450
For this we’ll need a diagram!

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:56.220
The Next State signal is
the input to the register

00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:00.870
so it has to meet the setup
and hold times as shown here.

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:03.330
Next we show the
Input signal and how

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:05.240
the timing of its
transitions affect

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:07.730
to the timing of the
Next State signal.

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:10.680
Now it’s pretty easy to figure
out when Input has to be stable

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:15.360
before the rising clock edge,
i.e., the setup time for Input.

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:17.410
The setup time for
Input is the sum

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:19.510
of propagation
delay of the logic

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:22.280
plus the setup time
for the register, which

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:25.570
we calculate as 7ns.

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:29.300
In other words, if the Input
signal is stable at least 7ns

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:32.820
before the rising clock edge,
then Next State will be stable

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:36.780
at least 2ns before the rising
clock edge and hence meet

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:40.840
the register’s
specified setup time.

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:43.410
Similarly, the
hold time of Input

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:45.890
has to be the hold
time of the register

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:49.030
minus the contamination
delay of the logic, which

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:52.560
we calculate as 1ns.

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:55.230
In other words, if Input
is stable at least 1ns

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:58.160
after the rising clock
edge, then Next State

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:01.950
will be stable for another
1ns, i.e., a total of 2ns

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:04.210
after the rising clock edge.

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:08.480
This meets the specified
hold time of the register.

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:11.900
This completes our introduction
to sequential logic.

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:13.810
Pretty much every
digital system out

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:16.030
there is a sequential
logic system

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:19.060
and hence is obeying the
timing constraints imposed

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:21.190
by the dynamic discipline.

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:25.380
So next time you see an ad
for a 1.7 GHz processor chip,

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:28.850
you’ll know where
the “1.7” came from!
