00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:04.970
We can use a 2-to-1 multiplexer to build a
settable storage element.

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:10.170
Recall that a MUX selects as its output value
the value of one of its two data inputs.

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:15.050
The output of the MUX serves as the state
output of the memory component.

00:00:15.050 --> 00:00:19.250
Internally to the memory component we'll also
connect the output of the MUX to its D0 data

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:20.670
input.

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:26.060
The MUX's D1 data input will become the data
input of the memory component.

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:30.330
And the select line of the MUX will become
the memory component's load signal, here called

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:32.640
the gate.

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:37.530
When the gate input is LOW, the MUX's output
is looped back through MUX through the D0

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:41.079
data input,
forming the bi-stable positive feedback loop

00:00:41.079 --> 00:00:43.870
discussed in the last section.

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:50.390
Note our circuit now has a cycle, so it no
longer qualifies as a combinational circuit.

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:55.239
When the gate input is HIGH, the MUX's output
is determined by the value of the D1 input,

00:00:55.239 --> 00:00:59.000
i.e., the data input of the memory component.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.880
To load new data into the memory component,
we set the gate input HIGH for long enough

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:06.110
for the Q output to become valid and stable.

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:12.000
Looking at the truth table, we see that when
G is 1, the Q output follows the D input.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.789
While the G input is HIGH, any changes in
the D input will be reflected as changes in

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:22.090
the Q output, the timing being determined
by the tPD of the MUX.

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:27.210
Then we can set the gate input LOW to switch
the memory component into memory mode,

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:32.408
where the stable Q value is maintained indefinitely
by the positive feedback loop as shown in

00:01:32.408 --> 00:01:34.820
the first two rows of the truth table.

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:39.850
Our memory device is a called a D latch, or
just a latch for short, with the schematic

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:42.160
symbol shown here.

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:46.520
When the latch's gate is HIGH, the latch is
open and information flows from the D input

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:48.670
to the Q output.

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:53.650
When the latch's gate is LOW, the latch is
closed and in "memory mode", remembering whatever

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:58.729
value was on the D input when the gate transitioned
from HIGH to LOW.

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:01.950
This is shown in the timing diagrams on the
right.

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:06.479
The waveforms show when a signal is stable,
i.e., a constant signal that's either LOW

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:10.189
or HIGH,
and when a signal is changing, shown as one

00:02:10.189 --> 00:02:12.840
or more transitions between LOW and HIGH.

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:19.980
When G is HIGH, we can see Q changing to a
new stable output value no later than tPD

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:23.629
after D reaches a new stable value.

00:02:23.629 --> 00:02:28.549
Our theory is that after G transitions to
a LOW value, Q will stay stable at whatever

00:02:28.549 --> 00:02:32.590
value was on D when G made the HIGH to LOW
transition.

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:37.449
But, we know that in general, we can't assume
anything about the output of a combinational

00:02:37.449 --> 00:02:41.279
device until tPD after the input transition.

00:02:41.279 --> 00:02:47.130
The device is allowed to do whatever it wants
in the interval between tCD and tPD after

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:48.389
the input transition.

00:02:48.389 --> 00:02:54.750
But how will our memory work if the 1-to-0
transition on G causes the Q output to become

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:57.590
invalid for a brief interval?

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:01.730
After all it's the value on the Q output we're
trying to remember!

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:07.989
We're going to have ensure that a 1-to-0 transition
on G doesn't affect the Q output.

00:03:07.989 --> 00:03:11.999
That's why we specified a lenient MUX for
our memory component.

00:03:11.999 --> 00:03:15.010
The truth table for a lenient MUX is shown
here.

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:19.809
The output of a lenient MUX remains valid
and stable even after an input transition

00:03:19.809 --> 00:03:22.930
under any of the following three conditions.

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:28.829
(1) When we're loading the latch by setting
G HIGH, once the D input has been valid and

00:03:28.829 --> 00:03:32.930
stable for tPD,
we are guaranteed that the Q output will be

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:39.609
stable and valid with the same value as the
D input, independently of Q's initial value.

00:03:39.609 --> 00:03:46.389
Or (2) If both Q and D are valid and stable
for tPD, the Q output will be unaffected by

00:03:46.389 --> 00:03:49.829
subsequent transitions on the G input.

00:03:49.829 --> 00:03:55.359
This is the situation that will allow us to
have a 1-to-0 transition on G without contaminating

00:03:55.359 --> 00:03:56.609
the Q output.

00:03:56.609 --> 00:04:04.010
Or, finally, (3) if G is LOW and Q has been
stable for at least tPD, the output will be

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:08.500
unaffected by subsequent transitions on the
D input.

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:10.719
Does lenience guarantee a working latch?

00:04:10.719 --> 00:04:15.150
Well, only if we're careful about ensuring
that signals are stable at the right times

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:19.089
so we can leverage the lenient behavior of
the MUX.

00:04:19.089 --> 00:04:23.789
Here are the steps we need to follow in order
to ensure the latch will work as we want.

00:04:23.789 --> 00:04:28.990
First, while the G input is HIGH, set the
D input to the value we wish store in the

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:29.990
latch.

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:36.009
Then, after tPD, we're guaranteed that value
will be stable and valid on the Q output.

00:04:36.009 --> 00:04:40.120
This is condition (1) from the previous slide.

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:46.120
Now we wait another tPD so that the information
about the new value on the Q' input propagates

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:48.879
through the internal circuitry of the latch.

00:04:48.879 --> 00:04:55.330
Now, both D *and* Q' have been stable for
at least tPD, giving us condition (2) from

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:57.940
the previous slide.

00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:04.889
So if D is stable for 2*tPD, transitions on
G will not affect the Q output.

00:05:04.889 --> 00:05:09.509
This requirement on D is called the setup
time of the latch: it's how long D must be

00:05:09.509 --> 00:05:12.950
stable and valid before the HIGH-to-LOW transition
of G.

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:18.800
Now we can set G to LOW, still holding D stable
and valid.

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:23.380
After another tPD to allow the new G value
to propagate through the internal circuitry

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:28.330
of the latch, we've satisfied condition (3)
from the previous slide,

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:34.180
and the Q output will be unaffected by subsequent
transitions on D.

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:38.270
This further requirement on D's stability
is called the hold time of the latch:

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:43.990
it's how long after the transition on G that
D must stay stable and valid.

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:48.039
Together the setup and hold time requirements
are called the dynamic discipline, which must

00:05:48.039 --> 00:05:51.550
be followed if the latch is to operate correctly.

00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:57.270
In summary, the dynamic discipline requires
that the D input be stable and valid both

00:05:57.270 --> 00:06:00.040
before and after a transition on G.

00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:05.259
If our circuit is designed to obey the dynamic
discipline, we can guarantee that this memory

00:06:05.259 --> 00:06:10.849
component will reliably store the information
on D when the gate makes a HIGH-to-LOW transition.
