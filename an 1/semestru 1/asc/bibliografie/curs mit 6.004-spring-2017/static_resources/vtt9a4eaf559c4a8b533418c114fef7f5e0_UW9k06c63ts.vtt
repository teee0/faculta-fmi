00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:05.759
Let's create a new abstraction called a "process"
to capture the notion of a running program.

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:10.330
A process encompasses all the resources that
would be used when running a program including

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:16.119
those of the CPU, the MMU, input and output
devices, etc.

00:00:16.119 --> 00:00:21.250
Each process has a "state" that captures everything
we know about its execution.

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:26.140
The process state includes
* the hardware state of the CPU, i.e., the

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:29.050
values in the registers and program counter.

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:34.109
* the contents of the process' virtual address
space, including code, data values, the stack,

00:00:34.109 --> 00:00:38.100
and data objects dynamically allocated from
the heap.

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:42.710
Under the management of the MMU, this portion
of the state can be resident in main memory

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:46.379
or can reside in secondary storage.

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:51.329
* the hardware state of the MMU, which, as
we saw earlier, depends on the context-number

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:53.760
and page-directory registers.

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:58.719
Also included are the pages allocated for
the hierarchical page map.

00:00:58.719 --> 00:01:03.129
* additional information about the process'
input and output activities, such as where

00:01:03.129 --> 00:01:06.750
it has reached in reading or writing files
in the file system,

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:10.360
the status and buffers associated with open
network connections,

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:15.390
pending events from the user interface (e.g.,
keyboard characters and mouse clicks), and

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:16.680
so on.

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:23.350
As we'll see, there is a special, privileged
process, called the operating system (OS),

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:26.460
running in its own kernel-mode context.

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:33.579
The OS manages all the bookkeeping for each
process, arranging for the process run periodically.

00:01:33.579 --> 00:01:38.929
The OS will provide various services to the
processes, such as accessing data in files,

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:43.710
establishing network connections, managing
the window system and user interface, and

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:44.710
so on.

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:49.859
To switch from running one user-mode process
to another, the OS will need to capture and

00:01:49.859 --> 00:01:54.450
save the *entire* state of the current user-mode
process.

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:58.319
Some of it already lives in main memory, so
we're all set there.

00:01:58.319 --> 00:02:01.810
Some of it will be found in various kernel
data structures.

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:06.579
And some of it we'll need to be able to save
and restore from the various hardware resources

00:02:06.579 --> 00:02:09.800
in the CPU and MMU.

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:15.470
In order to successfully implement processes,
the OS must be able to make it seem as if

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:21.079
each process was running on its own "virtual
machine" that works independently of other

00:02:21.079 --> 00:02:24.420
virtual machines for other processes.

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:30.610
Our goal is to efficiently share one physical
machine between all the virtual machines.

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:33.920
Here's a sketch of the organization we're
proposing.

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:38.800
The resources provided by a physical machine
are shown at the bottom of the slide.

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:44.000
The CPU and main memory form the computation
engine at heart of the system.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.550
Connected to the CPU are various peripherals,
a collective noun coined from the English

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:53.510
word "periphery" that indicates the resources
surrounding the CPU.

00:02:53.510 --> 00:03:00.970
A timer generates periodic CPU interrupts
that can be used to trigger periodic actions.

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:06.730
Secondary storage provides high-capacity non-volatile
memories for the system.

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:09.250
Connections to the outside world are important
too.

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:13.480
Many computers include USB connections for
removable devices.

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:17.620
And most provide wired or wireless network
connections.

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:22.041
And finally there are usually video monitors,
keyboards and mice that serve as the user

00:03:22.041 --> 00:03:23.720
interface.

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:30.520
Cameras and microphones are becoming increasing
important as the next generation of user interface.

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:35.829
The physical machine is managed by the OS
running in the privileged kernel context.

00:03:35.829 --> 00:03:40.980
The OS handles the low-level interfaces to
the peripherals, initializes and manages the

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:43.230
MMU contexts, and so on.

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:49.960
It's the OS that creates the virtual machine
seen by each process.

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:54.610
User-mode programs run directly on the physical
processor, but their execution can be interrupted

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:57.810
by the timer,
giving the OS the opportunity to save away

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:02.230
the current process state and move to running
the next process.

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:08.500
Via the MMU, the OS provides each process
with an independent virtual address space

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:12.040
that's isolated from the actions of other
processes.

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:16.760
The virtual peripherals provided by the OS
isolate the process from all the details of

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:20.040
sharing resources with other processes.

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:25.250
The notion of a window allows the process
to access a rectangular array of pixels without

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:29.600
having to worry if some pixels in the window
are hidden by other windows.

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:33.460
Or worrying about how to ensure the mouse
cursor always appears on top of whatever is

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:36.730
being displayed, and so on.

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:42.480
Instead of accessing I/O devices directly,
each process has access to a stream of I/O

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:47.370
events that are generated when a character
is typed, the mouse is clicked, etc.

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:53.000
For example, the OS deals with how to determine
which typed characters belong to which process.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:57.740
In most window systems, the user clicks on
a window to indicate that the process that

00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:04.260
owns the window now has the keyboard focus
and should receive any subsequent typed characters.

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:08.380
And the position of the mouse when clicked
might determine which process receives the

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:09.710
click.

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:14.190
All of which is to say that the details of
sharing have been abstracted out of the simple

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:18.440
interface provided by the virtual peripherals.

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:21.880
The same is true of accessing files on disk.

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:27.070
The OS provides the useful abstraction of
having each file appear as a contiguous, growable

00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:31.510
array of bytes that supports read and write
operations.

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:36.670
The OS knows how the file is mapped to a pool
of sectors on the disk and deals with bad

00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:42.090
sectors, reducing fragmentation, and improving
throughput by doing read look-aheads and write

00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:44.150
behinds.

00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:49.590
For networks, the OS provides access to an
in-order stream of bytes to some remote socket.

00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:55.750
It implements the appropriate network protocols
for packetizing the stream, addressing the

00:05:55.750 --> 00:05:59.780
packets, and dealing with dropped, damaged,
or out-of-order packets.

00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:05.210
To configure and control these virtual services,
the process communicates with the OS using

00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:12.750
supervisor calls (SVCs), a type of controlled-access
procedure call that invokes code in the OS

00:06:12.750 --> 00:06:13.750
kernel.

00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:17.980
The details of the design and implementation
of each virtual service are beyond the scope

00:06:17.980 --> 00:06:19.400
of this course.

00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:23.210
If you're interested, a course on operating
systems will explore each of these topics

00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:25.980
in detail.

00:06:25.980 --> 00:06:31.300
The OS provides an independent virtual machine
for each process, periodically switching from

00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:35.419
running one process to running the next process.

00:06:35.419 --> 00:06:40.210
Let's follow along as we switch from running
process #0 to running process #1.

00:06:40.210 --> 00:06:46.150
Initially, the CPU is executing user-mode
code in process #0.

00:06:46.150 --> 00:06:51.330
That execution is interrupted, either by an
explicit yield by the program, or, more likely,

00:06:51.330 --> 00:06:53.620
by a timer interrupt.

00:06:53.620 --> 00:06:58.060
Either ends up transferring control to OS
code running in kernel mode, while saving

00:06:58.060 --> 00:07:01.280
the current PC+4 value in the XP register.

00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:05.900
We'll talk about the interrupt mechanism in
more detail in just a moment.

00:07:05.900 --> 00:07:11.120
The OS saves the state of process #0 in the
appropriate table in kernel storage.

00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:15.650
Then it reloads the state from the kernel
table for process #1.

00:07:15.650 --> 00:07:20.330
Note that the process #1 state was saved when
process #1 was interrupted at some earlier

00:07:20.330 --> 00:07:21.330
point.

00:07:21.330 --> 00:07:26.300
The OS then uses a JMP() to resume user-mode
execution using the newly restored process

00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:28.740
#1 state.

00:07:28.740 --> 00:07:34.050
Execution resumes in process #1 just where
it was when interrupted earlier.

00:07:34.050 --> 00:07:38.710
And now we're running the user-mode program
in process #1.

00:07:38.710 --> 00:07:43.320
We've interrupted one process and resumed
execution of another.

00:07:43.320 --> 00:07:47.890
We'll keep doing this in a round-robin fashion,
giving each process a chance to run, before

00:07:47.890 --> 00:07:51.260
starting another round of execution.

00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:54.820
The black arrows give a sense for how time
proceeds.

00:07:54.820 --> 00:08:01.190
For each process, virtual time unfolds as
a sequence of executed instructions.

00:08:01.190 --> 00:08:06.160
Unless it looks at a real-time clock, a process
is unaware that occasionally its execution

00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:08.450
is suspended for a while.

00:08:08.450 --> 00:08:14.120
The suspension and resumption are completely
transparent to a running process.

00:08:14.120 --> 00:08:18.620
Of course, from the outside we can see that
in real time, the execution path moves from

00:08:18.620 --> 00:08:24.780
process to process, visiting the OS during
switches, producing the dove-tailed execution

00:08:24.780 --> 00:08:27.770
path we see here.

00:08:27.770 --> 00:08:33.219
Time-multiplexing of the CPU is called "timesharing"
and we'll examine the implementation in more

00:08:33.219 --> 00:08:35.088
detail in the following segment.
