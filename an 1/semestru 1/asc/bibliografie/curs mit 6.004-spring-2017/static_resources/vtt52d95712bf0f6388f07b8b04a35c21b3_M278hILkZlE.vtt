00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:07.410
As presented in lecture, in this course, we
use a simple 32-bit processor called the Beta.

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:11.590
The Beta works on 32-bit instruction and data
words.

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:15.500
However, the addresses in memory are specified
in bytes.

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:22.810
A byte is made up of 8 bits, so each 32-bit
instruction consists of 4 bytes.

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:28.570
That means that if you have two instructions
A and B in consecutive memory locations, if

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:35.649
A is at address 0x100, then B is at address
0x104.

00:00:35.649 --> 00:00:42.370
Now, suppose that you are given the following
piece of code.

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:47.019
The . = 0 notation tells you that your program
begins at address 0.

00:00:47.019 --> 00:00:52.809
You can assume that execution begins at this
location 0 and halts when the HALT() instruction

00:00:52.809 --> 00:00:55.449
is about to be executed.

00:00:55.449 --> 00:01:00.460
We want to determine what value ends up in
R0 after this instruction sequence has been

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:02.290
executed.

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:06.830
Note that we are working with hexadecimal
numbers in this code and we want our answer

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:09.900
to also be in hexadecimal.

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:14.680
This code begins with a LD operation into
register R0.

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:21.120
The load, uses the value of R31 + c as the
source address for the load.

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:29.220
Since R31 = 0, this means that the value stored
at address c is being loaded into R0.

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:35.460
So after the LD, R0 = 0x300.

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:41.830
Next an ADDC of R0 with the constant b is
performed and that result is stored back into

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:44.539
R0.

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:53.450
The .=0x200 notation immediately preceding
the "a" label, tells us that address a = 0x200.

00:01:53.450 --> 00:02:02.160
This means that address b = 0x204, and c = 0x208.

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:16.709
So if we are adding the constant b to R0,
R0 now becomes 0x300 + 0x204 = 0x504.

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:20.090
Now lets take a look at this short piece of
code.

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:26.950
Our goal is to determine the value left in
R0 in hexadecimal.

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:32.810
The . = 0 notation once again tells us that
our first instruction (the branch) is at address

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:34.160
0.

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:43.480
The branch instruction then branches to location
. + 4 = 0 + 4 = 4.

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:46.590
This is the address of the HALT() instruction.

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:52.510
In addition to branching to the HALT() instruction,
a branch instruction also stores the address

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:59.209
of the instruction immediately following it
into the destination register, R0 in this

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:00.209
case.

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:07.610
The address of the next instruction is 4,
so R0 = 0x4.

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:12.180
Let's take a look at what this code is doing.

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:26.810
It first loads the contents of address x into
R0, so R0 = 0x0FACE0FF or 0xFACEOFF for short.

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:33.110
It then moves the constant 0 into R1, so R1
= 0.

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:40.489
It now enters the loop where the ANDC puts
into R3 the least significant bit of R0.

00:03:40.489 --> 00:03:45.260
The ADD increments R1 if R3 equals 1.

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:51.750
This means that if the least significant bit
of R0 was a 1, then R1 is incremented by 1,

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:54.790
otherwise R1 stays the same.

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:59.790
The shift right constant then shifts R0 to
the right by 1.

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:06.909
This makes R0 have a 0 in the most significant
bit, and the top 31 bits, of what R0 used

00:04:06.909 --> 00:04:11.420
to be, are shifted over by one position to
the right.

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:17.399
Note that this means that the least significant
bit of the old R0 is now completely gone.

00:04:17.399 --> 00:04:22.960
That's okay though because we already incremented
R1 based on that original least significant

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:25.560
bit of R0.

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:32.090
The BNE, or branch on not equal, then branches
back to loop as long as R0 is not equal to

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:33.570
0.

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:37.940
This means that what this loop is doing is
looking at the current least significant bit

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:42.360
of R0,
incrementing R1 if that bit is 1,

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:46.860
and then shifting that bit out until all bits
have been shifted out.

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:51.699
In other words, it's counting the total number
of ones in the original value loaded from

00:04:51.699 --> 00:04:53.560
address x.

00:04:53.560 --> 00:05:00.830
The loop ends when all the 1's have been counted
at which point R0 is left with a 0 in it because

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:03.720
all the 1's have been shifted out.

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:20.750
R1 is left with the number of 1's in the data
0x0FACE0FF equals in binary 0000 1111 1010

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:31.539
1100 1110 0000 1111 1111.

00:05:31.539 --> 00:05:47.720
There are 19 ones in 0x0FACE0FF, so R1 = 19
= 16 + 3 which in hexadecimal = 0x13.

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:54.590
In this piece of code, the CMOVE first sets
the stack pointer to 0x1000.

00:05:54.590 --> 00:05:58.340
Then a PUSH(SP) operation is performed.

00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:01.510
Lets first understand what a PUSH instruction
does.

00:06:01.510 --> 00:06:06.919
A PUSH instruction is actually a macro made
up of two beta instructions.

00:06:06.919 --> 00:06:12.680
To push a value onto the stack, the stack
pointer is first incremented by 4 in order

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:16.550
to point to the next empty location on the
stack.

00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:17.870
This sets SP = 0x1004.

00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:27.110
Then, the contents of register Ra, which is
being pushed onto the stack, are stored at

00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:35.379
the memory location whose address is SP-4
which is address 0x1000.

00:06:35.379 --> 00:06:42.500
Now looking at the actual PUSH operation performed
here, we are performing a PUSH of stack pointer

00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:47.169
so the Ra register is also the stack pointer.

00:06:47.169 --> 00:06:54.550
This means that the value stored at location
0x1000 is actually the value of SP which is

00:06:54.550 --> 00:06:57.710
0x1004.

00:06:57.710 --> 00:07:03.289
So the value that got pushed onto the stack
is 0x1004.
