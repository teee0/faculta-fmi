00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:05.790
In this problem, we are given
a function Z equal to ((A OR B)

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:09.110
AND C), the whole thing negated.

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:12.060
We are then asked to
produce a CMOS circuit that

00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:14.440
implements the function Z.

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:16.740
We know that our CMOS
circuits consists

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:20.080
of a pull-down circuit
made up purely of NFETs,

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:23.290
and it is called pull-down
because if it is on,

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:28.530
it connects the output to ground
to produce a low (or 0) output.

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:32.830
We also have a pull-up circuit
made up purely of PFETs,

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:36.040
and it is called a pull-up
because if it is on,

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:41.810
it connects the output to Vdd
to produce a high (or 1) output.

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:50.080
If Z = NOT((A OR B) AND C),
then NOT(Z) = ((A OR B) AND C).

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:52.660
To draw the pull-down
portion of this circuit,

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:57.100
we take a look at when the
function produces Z = 0.

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:00.990
This occurs when ((A
or B) and C) equals 1,

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:05.470
so the pull-down circuitry
should be on when ((A or B)

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:07.930
and C) equals 1.

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:14.030
So (A OR B) = 1 and C = 1.

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:19.120
This means that we want a
parallel(A,B) in series with C

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:21.870
circuit for our pull-down.

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:27.200
The parallel(A,B) corresponds to
(A OR B) = 1 because if either

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:31.620
A or B equals 1 then we have
a path from Z to the bottom

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:33.880
of the parallel circuitry.

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:39.010
Then if C is also 1, we complete
our path between Z and ground.

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:45.660
So, if either (A = 1 and C
= 1) or (B = 1 and C = 1),

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:50.320
Z is pulled down to ground
and produces a 0 output.

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:52.760
To generate our
pull-up, we simply

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:55.300
replace parallel
circuits with series,

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:57.540
and series with parallel.

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:00.860
This will ensure that whenever
our pull-down circuit is off,

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:03.210
our pull-up circuit is on.

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:09.870
So our pull-up circuitry is
series(A,B) in parallel with C.

00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:12.230
To convince ourselves
that this is in fact

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:15.410
the correct pull-up circuit,
we know that the pull-up

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:18.080
must make Z equal to 1.

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:24.490
Z = 1 if ((A OR B) AND C) the
whole thing negated equals 1,

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:29.530
or ((A OR B) AND C) = 0.

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:35.150
This is true when either
(A OR B) = 0 or C = 0.

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:42.590
This means that either A =
0 and B = 0 OR just C = 0.

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:46.500
Pull-up circuits use PFETs which
are on when the input is low

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:47.720
(or 0).

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:54.060
So the equivalent circuit for
this is series(A,B) ORed with C

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:59.660
which is equal to series(A,B)
in parallel with C.
