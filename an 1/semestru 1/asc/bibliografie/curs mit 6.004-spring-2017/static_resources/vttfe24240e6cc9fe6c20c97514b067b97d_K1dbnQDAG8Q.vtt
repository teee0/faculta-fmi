00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.570
Serial point-to-point links
are the modern replacement

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:05.670
for the parallel
communications bus

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:08.070
with all its electrical
and timing issues.

00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:10.730
0..08 Each link is
unidirectional and has only

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:14.480
a single driver and the receiver
recovers the clock signal from

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:17.290
the data stream, so there are
no complications from sharing

00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:20.760
the channel, clock skew,
and electrical problems.

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:24.170
The very controlled electrical
environment enables very high

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:27.360
signaling rates, well up into
the gigahertz range using

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:29.210
today’s technologies.

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:30.790
If more throughput
is needed, you

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:33.980
can use multiple serial
links in parallel.

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:36.770
Extra logic is needed to
reassemble the original data

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:40.250
from multiple packets sent in
parallel over multiple links,

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:42.600
but the cost of the
required logic gates

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.270
is very modest in
current technologies.

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:49.080
Note that the expansion
strategy of modern systems

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:51.470
still uses the notion
of an add-in card that

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:53.330
plugs into the motherboard.

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:55.770
But instead of connecting
to a parallel bus,

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.300
the add-in card
connects to one or more

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:00.700
point-to-point
communication links.

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:02.880
Here’s the system-level
communications diagram

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:07.840
for a recent system based on
an Intel Core i7 CPU chip.

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:10.280
The CPU is connected
directly to the memories

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:13.090
for the highest-possible
memory bandwidth,

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:15.280
but talks to all
the other components

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:17.400
over the QuickPath
Interconnect (QPI),

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.500
which has 20
differential signaling

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.470
paths in each direction.

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:25.560
QPI supports up to 6.4
billion 20-bit transfers

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.450
in each direction every second.

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:30.370
All the other
communication channels

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:35.600
(USB, PCIe, networks,
Serial ATA, Audio, etc.)

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:39.290
are also serial links,
providing various communication

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:42.420
bandwidths depending
on the application.

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:45.110
Reading about the QPI
channel used by the CPU

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:48.220
reminded me a lot
of the one ring

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:49.840
that could be used
to control all

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:53.560
of Middle Earth in the Tolkien
trilogy Lord of the Rings.

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:56.320
Why mess around with a lot
of specialized communication

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:59.770
channels when you have a single
solution that’s powerful enough

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:02.540
to solve all your
communication needs?

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:05.730
PCI Express (PCIe) is often
used as the communication

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:08.840
link between components
on the system motherboard.

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:14.040
A single PCIe version 2 “lane”
transmits data at 5 Gb/sec

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:17.640
using low-voltage differential
signaling (LVDS) over wires

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:21.690
designed to have a 100-Ohm
characteristic impedance.

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:23.740
The PCIe lane is
under the control

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:27.460
of the same sort of network
stack as described earlier.

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:31.200
The physical layer transmits
packet data through the wire.

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:33.140
Each packet starts with
a training sequence

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:36.450
to synchronize the receiver’s
clock-recovery circuitry,

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:38.710
followed by a unique
start sequence,

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:42.230
then the packet’s data payload,
and ends with a unique end

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:44.430
sequence.

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:47.700
The physical layer payload is
organized as a sequence number,

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:51.390
a transaction-layer payload
and a cyclical redundancy check

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:54.230
sequence that’s used
to validate the data.

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:56.490
Using the sequence number,
the data link layer

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:58.770
can tell when a packet
has been dropped

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:01.480
and request the transmitter
restart transmission

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:03.360
at the missing packet.

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:06.120
It also deals with
flow control issues.

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:08.710
Finally, the transaction
layer reassembles the message

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:12.260
from the transaction layer
payloads from all the lanes

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:15.610
and uses the header to identify
the intended recipient at the

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:17.410
receive end.

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:20.420
Altogether, a significant amount
of logic is needed to send

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:23.390
and receive messages
on multiple PCIe lanes,

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:26.770
but the cost is quite acceptable
when using today’s integrated

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:29.150
circuit technologies.

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:33.340
Using 8 lanes, the maximum
transfer rate is 4 GB/sec,

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:36.640
capable of satisfying the needs
of high-performance peripherals

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:38.130
such as graphics cards.

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:40.290
So knowledge from
the networking world

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:43.620
has reshaped how components
communicate on the motherboard,

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:46.420
driving the transition
from parallel buses

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:49.770
to a handful of serial
point-to-point links.

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:53.460
As a result today’s systems
are faster, more reliable,

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:57.350
more energy-efficient and
smaller than ever before.
