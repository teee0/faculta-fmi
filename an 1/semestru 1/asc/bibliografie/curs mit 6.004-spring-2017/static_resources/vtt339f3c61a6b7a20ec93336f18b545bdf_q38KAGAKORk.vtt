WEBVTT

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:08.090
SARAH HANSEN: So how did
you become interested

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:10.228
in computation structures?

00:00:10.228 --> 00:00:12.020
CHRISTOPHER TERMAN:
Well, in the early '70s

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:15.470
I was a college student trying
to earn my way through college.

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:19.550
And so I was the computer
operator on the third shift

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:21.200
for the campus computer.

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:24.150
That was in the era in which
you could only afford one.

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:26.960
And since watching the
blinking lights was boring,

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:30.530
I pulled out the schematics
for the computer I

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:34.010
was running for the university.

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:37.880
And I started trying to figure
out how the computer worked.

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:41.370
Ever since then, it's been
sort of a lifelong interest

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.820
in figuring out,
how do they actually

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:46.220
put together these components
to make a machine that

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:48.620
can do computation?

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:50.060
SARAH HANSEN: And
that interest is

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:52.730
coupled with your interest
in teaching and learning,

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:56.145
and especially online education.

00:00:56.145 --> 00:00:57.770
Could you talk a
little bit about where

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:00.020
that interest comes from?

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:04.970
CHRISTOPHER TERMAN: Well,
I was always fascinated

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:09.650
and very motivated by the great
teachers I could listen to.

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:12.440
And so everybody picks
a model when they're

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:14.150
a teenager or a young
adult. They say,

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:15.710
I want to be like so-and-so.

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:17.270
Well, the so-and-sos
I liked to pick

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:19.280
were the excellent
teachers I had.

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:22.820
So I said, I'm going to try
to be the best teacher I can.

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:25.670
There's something very
satisfying about teaching

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:28.160
students and having them
nod and suddenly get it.

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:35.940
So it's been sort of a very
fulfilling experience to teach.

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:38.270
And so that's sort of a
virtuous cycle, right?

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:40.580
You get good vibes
from teaching.

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:42.290
And then you do it
better next year.

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:43.340
And you get better vibes.

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:46.370
And so for 40 years,
that's been a great--

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:48.078
it's been great.

00:01:48.078 --> 00:01:50.120
SARAH HANSEN: What kind
of background experiences

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:52.700
do the students bring related
to computation structures?

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:53.920
CHRISTOPHER TERMAN:
It's all over the map.

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:54.890
It's all over the map.

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:59.390
So some of them will come
having programmed computers

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:01.730
for a long time, and maybe
even know a little bit

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:05.030
about how the computers are
structured on the insides.

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:07.220
Other people have
not done beans.

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:10.070
They're just-- I wanted
to take a course.

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:13.130
I've used computers,
sort of browsers,

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:14.750
laptops, email, sort of thing.

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:20.960
But they have no idea about
the OS or the actual hardware

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:21.950
inside.

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:25.670
And so they come with interest,
but no background at all.

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:29.120
SARAH HANSEN: So how do
you structure a course

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:32.300
to meet the needs of people with
diverse backgrounds like that?

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:33.383
CHRISTOPHER TERMAN: Right.

00:02:33.383 --> 00:02:40.100
So to handle really
diverse backgrounds,

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:42.830
you have to have a huge
range of materials.

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:44.800
So you need something
that somebody who just--

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:46.370
I need to start
at the beginning.

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:48.410
You need a beginning
for them to start at.

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:50.823
And for somebody who's
sort of past the first half

00:02:50.823 --> 00:02:52.740
of your material, you
need a second half which

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:54.590
will engage their interests.

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:56.760
So I create a huge--

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:58.040
I think of it as a buffet.

00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:59.590
There's lots of dishes.

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:01.700
And you can start at the
beginning of the buffet

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:04.910
and sort of pick
it up from scratch.

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:08.300
Or you can say, I'll skip
the first couple courses,

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:11.000
and I'm ready to dive
in sort of in the middle

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:12.650
of the conversation somewhere.

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:15.680
So I think the real key
is having a huge selection

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:17.060
of materials to draw from.

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:20.810
And that's, I think, one
of the hallmarks of 6.004

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:24.958
has been that we have
every possible way

00:03:24.958 --> 00:03:26.000
of learning the material.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.490
So not only for
different backgrounds,

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:30.300
but for different
learning styles.

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:33.770
So some students want
to talk or listen.

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:35.240
Some students want to read.

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:37.460
Some students just
want to work on P-sets

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:41.675
and do just-in-time learning,
where they sort of say,

00:03:41.675 --> 00:03:42.800
here's what I need to know.

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:44.220
Now I'll go look
at the material,

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:46.760
just find the worked
example, and if I

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:48.380
don't understand
the worked example,

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:51.230
I'll go actually read the text.

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:55.480
So they actually only get to
the beginning of, if you will,

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:58.850
the introductory or the
explanatory material only,

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:01.070
and as a last resort
if they somehow

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:02.990
didn't pick it up from before.

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:03.110
SARAH HANSEN:
That's interesting.

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:05.690
CHRISTOPHER TERMAN: So many
different learning styles,

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:07.580
many different backgrounds.

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:13.850
SARAH HANSEN: How has the MITx
Residential platform enabled

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:17.131
you to provide this buffet?

00:04:17.131 --> 00:04:18.589
CHRISTOPHER TERMAN:
Well, one, it's

00:04:18.589 --> 00:04:21.920
a one-stop shop for all the
different sorts of materials.

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:25.310
And the other is there's sort
of an emerging best practice

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:30.260
about how to explain material
to people for the first time.

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:34.760
So you want to do short bites;
sound bites, video bites.

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:36.800
You know, those short
segments of learning

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:40.280
where you introduce a single
skill or a single concept.

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:43.580
And then you take a moment
to actually give them

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:46.370
some check yourself questions.

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:49.370
So the idea is in theory
you just listened to this

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:50.760
or watched it.

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:53.310
I'm going to ask you some
simple questions, not puzzlers.

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:55.460
They're just if you
understood what I just

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:58.310
told you on the video,
then you can answer them.

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:00.620
And so that gives
those students a chance

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:03.440
to start the process
of retrieval learning,

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:05.920
where you keep coming
back again and again.

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:08.950
And I'll ask you a similar sort
of question two segments later.

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:11.128
And pretty soon,
you're pulling it out

00:05:11.128 --> 00:05:13.420
of your short-term, and then
medium-term, and long-term

00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:15.490
memories.

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:20.620
So the MITx platform
works really

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:23.680
well at letting you construct
those sort of learning

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:24.850
sequences.

00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:26.680
And I think the
students appreciate it.

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:28.900
Everything is more
and more bite-sized.

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:31.000
We both know, as
you can imagine,

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:35.080
pushing play on a 50-minute
video and along about minute--

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:37.870
well, I'm going to say 37,
but along about minute six,

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:40.007
you're going to be,
all right, maybe I

00:05:40.007 --> 00:05:42.090
should check my email while
I'm listening to this.

00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:42.600
SARAH HANSEN: Right.

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:45.250
CHRISTOPHER TERMAN: It's
keeping things short and sweet.

00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:46.890
So you have a huge--

00:05:46.890 --> 00:05:49.510
because now you have a
bunch of short bites.

00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:52.210
Now, the MITx platform
lets you organize

00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:55.390
those with questions that
let you sort of continue

00:05:55.390 --> 00:05:56.750
to test your learning.

00:05:56.750 --> 00:06:02.140
So it's actually worked out to
be a very nice way of making

00:06:02.140 --> 00:06:05.290
a fairly organized tour
through the material

00:06:05.290 --> 00:06:09.400
that the students can start,
and stop, and come back to.

00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:10.570
Plus it's asynchronous.

00:06:10.570 --> 00:06:14.770
In other words, they get to
choose their time and place.

00:06:14.770 --> 00:06:17.710
And us teachers always
have a fantasy, well,

00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:19.775
they didn't come to
lecture, so I'm sure at 3:00

00:06:19.775 --> 00:06:21.400
in the morning when
they're wide awake,

00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:22.420
they're actually watching it.

00:06:22.420 --> 00:06:23.590
SARAH HANSEN: Of course.

00:06:23.590 --> 00:06:24.130
CHRISTOPHER TERMAN:
If you actually

00:06:24.130 --> 00:06:26.080
look at the statistics
for the viewing,

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:29.560
there's a lot of viewing
that happens in quiz weeks.

00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:32.120
So a lot of people may
be using it as sort of a,

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:37.030
OK, I want the intense,
immersive introduction

00:06:37.030 --> 00:06:37.970
to the material.

00:06:37.970 --> 00:06:39.115
SARAH HANSEN: Right.

00:06:39.115 --> 00:06:41.320
This must be just such
an exciting time for you

00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:43.750
as someone who's really
interested in the scholarship

00:06:43.750 --> 00:06:45.167
of teaching and
learning, and then

00:06:45.167 --> 00:06:47.650
the emergence of
these digital tools

00:06:47.650 --> 00:06:51.160
to enable that learning
through best practices.

00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:54.978
I can feel your enthusiasm for
kind of the era that we're in.

00:06:54.978 --> 00:06:56.020
CHRISTOPHER TERMAN: Yeah.

00:06:56.020 --> 00:07:01.030
Well, so much of how us
people-- or those of us who

00:07:01.030 --> 00:07:05.830
teach at the university level,
we get handed a piece of chalk

00:07:05.830 --> 00:07:08.883
and be told to teach,
unlike the teachers

00:07:08.883 --> 00:07:10.300
for your kids in
elementary school

00:07:10.300 --> 00:07:12.940
who've actually gone through
a program that teaches them

00:07:12.940 --> 00:07:13.590
how to teach.

00:07:13.590 --> 00:07:16.340
We're just said, here teach.

00:07:16.340 --> 00:07:18.070
And so it's all anecdotal.

00:07:18.070 --> 00:07:22.090
It's all trying to remember
how people taught you.

00:07:22.090 --> 00:07:25.060
Finally, we have the
online courses providing

00:07:25.060 --> 00:07:26.950
a real educational laboratory.

00:07:26.950 --> 00:07:29.020
We're able to try out
different techniques.

00:07:29.020 --> 00:07:32.350
We're able to make fairly
accurate assessments

00:07:32.350 --> 00:07:35.380
of how well did that
just work, whether it

00:07:35.380 --> 00:07:39.430
was an exercise, or a video
segment, or a design problem.

00:07:39.430 --> 00:07:44.080
And so we can actually do
A/B tests in the same cadre.

00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:47.020
So it's pretty
neat having a lab.

00:07:47.020 --> 00:07:49.450
I mean, as a scientist and
engineer, you can say, look,

00:07:49.450 --> 00:07:52.670
I know about the hypothesis.

00:07:52.670 --> 00:07:55.300
Test it through a
bunch of experiments.

00:07:55.300 --> 00:07:57.918
We can really do the experiments
with the MITx platform.

00:07:57.918 --> 00:07:58.960
And so that's been great.

00:07:58.960 --> 00:08:00.430
SARAH HANSEN: Yeah,
it's really exciting.

00:08:00.430 --> 00:08:01.630
CHRISTOPHER TERMAN: It is.

00:08:01.630 --> 00:08:04.870
SARAH HANSEN: Let's talk about
learning in the classroom

00:08:04.870 --> 00:08:09.310
and teaching large
lecture classes.

00:08:09.310 --> 00:08:13.855
What strategies do you have
for keeping students engaged?

00:08:13.855 --> 00:08:15.730
CHRISTOPHER TERMAN:
Well, that's interesting.

00:08:15.730 --> 00:08:20.360
Because we have so many
different materials,

00:08:20.360 --> 00:08:22.360
really the only students
who come to lecture

00:08:22.360 --> 00:08:25.740
are the ones for whom
lecture is how they learn.

00:08:25.740 --> 00:08:27.010
And I was such a student.

00:08:27.010 --> 00:08:27.940
SARAH HANSEN: I see.

00:08:27.940 --> 00:08:30.820
CHRISTOPHER TERMAN:
So the people

00:08:30.820 --> 00:08:34.480
who are there are
not a draft army.

00:08:34.480 --> 00:08:35.534
They're all volunteers.

00:08:35.534 --> 00:08:37.380
SARAH HANSEN: Self-selected.

00:08:37.380 --> 00:08:40.600
CHRISTOPHER TERMAN: So they're
prepared to be somewhat engaged

00:08:40.600 --> 00:08:41.867
by a vocal presentation.

00:08:41.867 --> 00:08:42.700
SARAH HANSEN: I see.

00:08:42.700 --> 00:08:47.290
CHRISTOPHER TERMAN: So I have a
well-developed set of materials

00:08:47.290 --> 00:08:49.240
that I present in
class that have

00:08:49.240 --> 00:08:53.140
sort of been debugged for having
not too much or too little.

00:08:53.140 --> 00:08:56.680
A progression that
most people can follow.

00:08:56.680 --> 00:09:00.340
And then happily, when
you teach for a while,

00:09:00.340 --> 00:09:01.960
you start to get more relaxed.

00:09:01.960 --> 00:09:05.260
And so it's a very relaxed
sort of experience.

00:09:05.260 --> 00:09:05.980
I tell jokes.

00:09:05.980 --> 00:09:07.960
I tell stories from my career.

00:09:07.960 --> 00:09:11.260
And it's interesting to me how
when the students are making

00:09:11.260 --> 00:09:14.320
comments at the end of the
semester on the evaluations,

00:09:14.320 --> 00:09:16.840
many of them say, I
really liked the stories.

00:09:16.840 --> 00:09:17.923
SARAH HANSEN: Interesting.

00:09:17.923 --> 00:09:19.750
CHRISTOPHER TERMAN:
So after boring you

00:09:19.750 --> 00:09:21.580
with technical details,
it's fun to say,

00:09:21.580 --> 00:09:23.410
and then when I
tried to use that,

00:09:23.410 --> 00:09:25.650
this following thing happened.

00:09:25.650 --> 00:09:28.390
And all of a sudden, they're
sort of perking up, saying, oh.

00:09:28.390 --> 00:09:30.580
SARAH HANSEN: And I think it
helps them remember the related

00:09:30.580 --> 00:09:30.970
content, too.

00:09:30.970 --> 00:09:31.600
CHRISTOPHER TERMAN: It does.

00:09:31.600 --> 00:09:32.100
It does.

00:09:32.100 --> 00:09:34.690
When you think about what
you remember from lectures,

00:09:34.690 --> 00:09:36.790
it's almost never
a technical nugget.

00:09:36.790 --> 00:09:40.480
It's a joke they told, or
an accident that happened,

00:09:40.480 --> 00:09:41.700
or a mistake that was made.

00:09:41.700 --> 00:09:41.990
SARAH HANSEN: Right.

00:09:41.990 --> 00:09:43.750
CHRISTOPHER TERMAN:
And so it's--

00:09:43.750 --> 00:09:47.090
there's this concept
called fluency,

00:09:47.090 --> 00:09:50.640
which is basically how
smoothly things are going,

00:09:50.640 --> 00:09:53.190
and everybody's nodding.

00:09:53.190 --> 00:09:56.080
So your mind is starting to
drift, because it's all--

00:09:56.080 --> 00:09:59.140
so it's actually good to try
to put a little disfluency

00:09:59.140 --> 00:10:02.232
into your lecture, to
actually have a-- you stop,

00:10:02.232 --> 00:10:03.407
and you tell a joke.

00:10:03.407 --> 00:10:04.240
SARAH HANSEN: Right.

00:10:04.240 --> 00:10:05.990
CHRISTOPHER TERMAN:
Or you make a mistake,

00:10:05.990 --> 00:10:08.020
or you drop the
chalk, and say, darn,

00:10:08.020 --> 00:10:09.190
and you look at the floor.

00:10:09.190 --> 00:10:10.600
SARAH HANSEN: Right.

00:10:10.600 --> 00:10:12.058
CHRISTOPHER TERMAN:
And here's what

00:10:12.058 --> 00:10:14.320
I like to do is you walk
out from behind the lecture

00:10:14.320 --> 00:10:17.880
table or lectern, and you
approach the audience.

00:10:17.880 --> 00:10:22.340
And you can see them sort of
going, wait, he's escaped.

00:10:22.340 --> 00:10:26.530
So just anything that sort of
switches up the sort of I'm

00:10:26.530 --> 00:10:28.300
just going along
with the flow here.

00:10:28.300 --> 00:10:33.160
So making little flows that
have things that change

00:10:33.160 --> 00:10:36.700
make a lot of difference in
keeping people sort of engaged.

00:10:36.700 --> 00:10:39.280
SARAH HANSEN:
That's a great tip.

00:10:39.280 --> 00:10:42.640
Let's talk for a second
about the teaching team.

00:10:42.640 --> 00:10:44.530
I understand there
are a fair number

00:10:44.530 --> 00:10:48.040
of people involved in developing
and teaching this course.

00:10:48.040 --> 00:10:49.240
Could you talk about that?

00:10:49.240 --> 00:10:51.240
CHRISTOPHER TERMAN: Well,
we have a little cadre

00:10:51.240 --> 00:10:53.650
of people who are instructors.

00:10:53.650 --> 00:10:56.440
I've been sort of part of
that cadre every semester

00:10:56.440 --> 00:10:58.120
for a very long time.

00:10:58.120 --> 00:11:01.180
But we have other people who
come in from the outside.

00:11:01.180 --> 00:11:05.710
In recent years, the department
has added lecturer resources.

00:11:05.710 --> 00:11:08.770
So there's another lecturer
associated with it.

00:11:08.770 --> 00:11:10.780
And then faculty come in.

00:11:10.780 --> 00:11:12.898
And they provide a little
depth to the gene pool.

00:11:12.898 --> 00:11:13.690
SARAH HANSEN: Sure.

00:11:13.690 --> 00:11:15.880
CHRISTOPHER TERMAN: But
then we have graduate TAs

00:11:15.880 --> 00:11:17.350
who teach recitations.

00:11:17.350 --> 00:11:23.170
And we have student
undergraduate TAs, and then

00:11:23.170 --> 00:11:23.920
lab assistants.

00:11:23.920 --> 00:11:25.930
So sort of we have
this whole hierarchy.

00:11:25.930 --> 00:11:27.790
They've all taken the course.

00:11:27.790 --> 00:11:29.860
Almost, they've all loved it.

00:11:29.860 --> 00:11:32.770
So I mean, it's sort of the
material that people say,

00:11:32.770 --> 00:11:34.330
oh, this is really pretty neat.

00:11:34.330 --> 00:11:36.400
I can't wait to tell the next
person about how this works.

00:11:36.400 --> 00:11:37.233
SARAH HANSEN: Right.

00:11:37.233 --> 00:11:40.900
CHRISTOPHER TERMAN: And so
as they sit there and work

00:11:40.900 --> 00:11:43.990
with the students,
sort of like me,

00:11:43.990 --> 00:11:46.000
there's an enthusiasm
that sort of bubbles out.

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:47.330
SARAH HANSEN: It's contagious.

00:11:47.330 --> 00:11:48.460
CHRISTOPHER TERMAN: Yeah.

00:11:48.460 --> 00:11:50.470
And the students actually--

00:11:50.470 --> 00:11:52.900
I sort of listed
things sort of--

00:11:52.900 --> 00:11:54.360
well, I was going
to say top down.

00:11:54.360 --> 00:11:57.290
I'm not sure lecturers
are at the top

00:11:57.290 --> 00:11:59.288
or instructors are at the top.

00:11:59.288 --> 00:12:01.330
But the students actually
prefer the other thing,

00:12:01.330 --> 00:12:06.590
which is actually asking an
LA is not very intimidating.

00:12:06.590 --> 00:12:09.250
The students, maybe they
just took it last semester.

00:12:09.250 --> 00:12:11.170
And so they have it
fresh in their minds

00:12:11.170 --> 00:12:15.100
what it is they needed to
do in order to get whatever

00:12:15.100 --> 00:12:17.410
it is they're trying to get.

00:12:17.410 --> 00:12:19.720
And then you sort of
work the chain up,

00:12:19.720 --> 00:12:25.930
work up the hierarchy to get
an answer of people below.

00:12:25.930 --> 00:12:27.940
And that way you're
only asking questions

00:12:27.940 --> 00:12:30.700
of the more
intimidating people when

00:12:30.700 --> 00:12:33.140
you're pretty sure that no
one else has the answer.

00:12:33.140 --> 00:12:36.340
So it's really-- by the time
the questions sort of get to me,

00:12:36.340 --> 00:12:40.690
mostly no one is worried
that they're a dumb question.

00:12:40.690 --> 00:12:43.093
Now, I don't really
believe in dumb questions.

00:12:43.093 --> 00:12:45.010
I think all questions
are sort of interesting.

00:12:45.010 --> 00:12:49.000
But I think the students
are, look, I asked 10 people.

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:51.250
None of us knew, so
now we can ask you.

00:12:51.250 --> 00:12:54.970
And I'm pretty confident that
it wasn't an obvious thing

00:12:54.970 --> 00:12:59.410
that if I only read the
assignment I would have known.

00:12:59.410 --> 00:13:04.120
So that sort of range of sort
of experience level and age,

00:13:04.120 --> 00:13:06.310
at the high end of
the experience level,

00:13:06.310 --> 00:13:07.900
you can get an answer
to any question.

00:13:07.900 --> 00:13:09.880
At the beginning end of
the experience level,

00:13:09.880 --> 00:13:11.220
you're talking to somebody who--

00:13:11.220 --> 00:13:12.660
SARAH HANSEN: Just
had that experience

00:13:12.660 --> 00:13:15.077
CHRISTOPHER TERMAN: Just months
ago did what you're doing.

00:13:15.077 --> 00:13:16.660
And so we can be--

00:13:16.660 --> 00:13:19.120
I can ask you, and we
won't be embarrassed.

00:13:19.120 --> 00:13:20.890
SARAH HANSEN: Right, right.

00:13:20.890 --> 00:13:23.490
What's the role
of the online fora

00:13:23.490 --> 00:13:25.570
in the course for
helping students feel

00:13:25.570 --> 00:13:27.220
comfortable asking questions?

00:13:27.220 --> 00:13:29.320
And how do you monitor it?

00:13:29.320 --> 00:13:30.930
How do you run it productively?

00:13:30.930 --> 00:13:34.990
This is something that educators
sometimes struggle with.

00:13:34.990 --> 00:13:38.050
CHRISTOPHER TERMAN:
Well, I mean, to me,

00:13:38.050 --> 00:13:39.400
it's a wonderful asset.

00:13:39.400 --> 00:13:42.670
For the first time I'm able
to make a thoughtful answer

00:13:42.670 --> 00:13:45.370
to a question and
have 180 people look

00:13:45.370 --> 00:13:46.770
at the answer instead of one.

00:13:46.770 --> 00:13:49.270
And then the next person who
has the same question, you say,

00:13:49.270 --> 00:13:52.270
well, I just spent 10 minutes.

00:13:52.270 --> 00:13:55.120
And with a large class,
you can't spend 10 minutes

00:13:55.120 --> 00:13:57.930
for each of 300 people.

00:13:57.930 --> 00:14:00.670
So it's a great place
to ask questions.

00:14:00.670 --> 00:14:03.610
I try to always give a
thoughtful and respectful

00:14:03.610 --> 00:14:06.400
answer to each question.

00:14:06.400 --> 00:14:08.200
So even if the question
is sort of like,

00:14:08.200 --> 00:14:10.900
well, if you had done the
reading, you would known,

00:14:10.900 --> 00:14:13.570
I say, well, if you look
back at the material,

00:14:13.570 --> 00:14:16.510
you'll see it explains
the following.

00:14:16.510 --> 00:14:18.070
Try to make it not--

00:14:18.070 --> 00:14:22.010
a little hint that maybe a
little bit more preparation.

00:14:22.010 --> 00:14:24.498
But many of the questions are,
look, I read the material.

00:14:24.498 --> 00:14:25.540
I'm still not getting it.

00:14:25.540 --> 00:14:28.430
I need an example.

00:14:28.430 --> 00:14:30.430
And so the students,
I try to make students

00:14:30.430 --> 00:14:31.802
feel very comfortable asking.

00:14:31.802 --> 00:14:33.010
It's never-- there's nothing.

00:14:33.010 --> 00:14:33.760
No cost.

00:14:33.760 --> 00:14:35.410
They can ask
anonymously, so that

00:14:35.410 --> 00:14:36.730
removes some of the barrier.

00:14:36.730 --> 00:14:37.900
SARAH HANSEN: OK.

00:14:37.900 --> 00:14:40.555
CHRISTOPHER TERMAN: And
then I think-- let's see.

00:14:40.555 --> 00:14:45.340
In the fall of 2017, we had
about 2,500 contributions

00:14:45.340 --> 00:14:46.050
to the forum.

00:14:46.050 --> 00:14:46.445
SARAH HANSEN: Wow.

00:14:46.445 --> 00:14:46.840
OK.

00:14:46.840 --> 00:14:48.715
CHRISTOPHER TERMAN: The
average response time

00:14:48.715 --> 00:14:50.800
is about 20 minutes.

00:14:50.800 --> 00:14:54.160
And so you say, wait, but
students are asking questions

00:14:54.160 --> 00:14:56.200
at 3:00 AM.

00:14:56.200 --> 00:14:57.280
How does that work?

00:14:57.280 --> 00:15:01.090
And it turns out
that we have TAs.

00:15:01.090 --> 00:15:03.053
We particularly have
some really good--

00:15:03.053 --> 00:15:04.220
SARAH HANSEN: Nocturnal TAs.

00:15:04.220 --> 00:15:05.800
CHRISTOPHER TERMAN:
Yes, exactly.

00:15:05.800 --> 00:15:08.610
At 3:00 AM they're just
hitting their stride.

00:15:08.610 --> 00:15:10.360
A lot of us who are
involved in the course

00:15:10.360 --> 00:15:13.090
sort of have-- we
put the notification

00:15:13.090 --> 00:15:15.010
of postings on real time.

00:15:15.010 --> 00:15:17.170
And so we get an
email right away.

00:15:17.170 --> 00:15:21.490
And so often we can
just type in an answer.

00:15:21.490 --> 00:15:22.270
And it's--

00:15:22.270 --> 00:15:23.170
SARAH HANSEN: OK.

00:15:23.170 --> 00:15:25.120
CHRISTOPHER TERMAN:
And I'm really--

00:15:25.120 --> 00:15:28.463
I think the fast response time
really reduces the frustration

00:15:28.463 --> 00:15:29.380
level of the students.

00:15:29.380 --> 00:15:29.800
SARAH HANSEN: Ah.

00:15:29.800 --> 00:15:30.310
CHRISTOPHER TERMAN:
There's nothing

00:15:30.310 --> 00:15:31.717
like being stuck on something.

00:15:31.717 --> 00:15:32.550
SARAH HANSEN: Right.

00:15:32.550 --> 00:15:35.320
CHRISTOPHER TERMAN: And say,
I wish I could ask somebody.

00:15:35.320 --> 00:15:38.800
Well, for the first time,
it's 3:12 in the morning.

00:15:38.800 --> 00:15:43.130
And you can say, wait, I can
ask, and I can get an answer.

00:15:43.130 --> 00:15:46.300
And the students really,
really appreciate that.

00:15:46.300 --> 00:15:48.760
So the forum has
really, I think,

00:15:48.760 --> 00:15:54.700
changed students'
level of frustration

00:15:54.700 --> 00:15:56.860
when they get stuck.

00:15:56.860 --> 00:16:00.977
Being stuck is just a 10-minute
process, not a two-day process.

00:16:00.977 --> 00:16:01.810
SARAH HANSEN: Right.

00:16:01.810 --> 00:16:03.220
CHRISTOPHER TERMAN: My
god, the next office hours

00:16:03.220 --> 00:16:04.137
are after the weekend.

00:16:04.137 --> 00:16:05.610
What do I do?

00:16:05.610 --> 00:16:08.770
And of course, a lot of
students are doing work outside

00:16:08.770 --> 00:16:10.960
of sort of 9:00 to 5:00 hours.

00:16:10.960 --> 00:16:15.460
So it's a way for the staff to
be a 24/7 staff instead of just

00:16:15.460 --> 00:16:18.730
a 9:00 to 5:00, five
days a week staff.

00:16:18.730 --> 00:16:22.120
The staff like-- and then the
students work like that, too.

00:16:22.120 --> 00:16:25.270
Most of the people who
are helping on the forum

00:16:25.270 --> 00:16:27.940
are keeping the same schedule
as the users of the forum.

00:16:27.940 --> 00:16:30.120
So it's a good match.

00:16:30.120 --> 00:16:31.630
SARAH HANSEN: OK.

00:16:31.630 --> 00:16:33.760
Let's talk for a
minute about the lab

00:16:33.760 --> 00:16:36.520
experiences in the course.

00:16:36.520 --> 00:16:39.100
So students get
hands-on experience

00:16:39.100 --> 00:16:40.620
doing digital design.

00:16:40.620 --> 00:16:41.620
CHRISTOPHER TERMAN: Yes.

00:16:41.620 --> 00:16:43.330
SARAH HANSEN: Could
you talk about a few

00:16:43.330 --> 00:16:44.410
of those experiences?

00:16:44.410 --> 00:16:47.770
And also, does that take place
here where we are right now?

00:16:47.770 --> 00:16:48.800
CHRISTOPHER TERMAN: Well,
you can do it anywhere.

00:16:48.800 --> 00:16:49.640
It's browser-based.

00:16:49.640 --> 00:16:51.140
So there's no
software to download.

00:16:51.140 --> 00:16:51.880
It's just on the web.

00:16:51.880 --> 00:16:52.380
You go.

00:16:52.380 --> 00:16:53.810
SARAH HANSEN: I see.

00:16:53.810 --> 00:16:55.643
CHRISTOPHER TERMAN: And
so one of the things

00:16:55.643 --> 00:16:58.600
I enjoy doing is to build
browser-based computer-aided

00:16:58.600 --> 00:16:59.570
design tools.

00:16:59.570 --> 00:17:02.260
It turns out that they
actually work really well.

00:17:02.260 --> 00:17:03.850
The modern browser
environments are

00:17:03.850 --> 00:17:07.470
quite capable as a
programming environment.

00:17:07.470 --> 00:17:10.300
You have to learn a few tricks,
but once you do, it works well.

00:17:10.300 --> 00:17:13.450
So they're reasonably
high-performing tools.

00:17:13.450 --> 00:17:15.819
They can sit down and do.

00:17:15.819 --> 00:17:20.140
Much of the design work we do is
sort of design-driven learning,

00:17:20.140 --> 00:17:22.599
where we're actually trying
to get them to build something

00:17:22.599 --> 00:17:23.474
that we've described.

00:17:23.474 --> 00:17:24.550
SARAH HANSEN: I see.

00:17:24.550 --> 00:17:26.633
CHRISTOPHER TERMAN: And
we may have even told them

00:17:26.633 --> 00:17:28.630
in quite some detail
how it fits together,

00:17:28.630 --> 00:17:31.270
but there's something about
the old muscle memory bit

00:17:31.270 --> 00:17:33.970
about if you actually
build it yourself, drag

00:17:33.970 --> 00:17:36.860
the components on
and wire them up,

00:17:36.860 --> 00:17:38.620
you'll remember it much better.

00:17:38.620 --> 00:17:41.897
Or you'll ask yourself, wait,
does this go here or here?

00:17:41.897 --> 00:17:43.480
And then you say--
then you look back,

00:17:43.480 --> 00:17:45.580
and you're starting
to say, I'm looking

00:17:45.580 --> 00:17:47.680
at this diagram,
the instructions,

00:17:47.680 --> 00:17:50.860
for the first time with enough
care to appreciate that,

00:17:50.860 --> 00:17:53.860
oh, I have to put it this
way in order for it to work.

00:17:53.860 --> 00:17:57.460
And so we're sort of--

00:17:57.460 --> 00:18:00.220
hand and eye are engaged.

00:18:00.220 --> 00:18:03.890
It's not just a
listening experience.

00:18:03.890 --> 00:18:06.160
We are able to-- if
you assemble something,

00:18:06.160 --> 00:18:09.400
we build tests to see if
it functions correctly.

00:18:09.400 --> 00:18:13.033
And so you can tell right away
whether you've screwed it up.

00:18:13.033 --> 00:18:16.170
It's not like, well, I turn
it in, and a week later--

00:18:16.170 --> 00:18:18.740
long past when I've
ceased to care--

00:18:18.740 --> 00:18:22.560
I get back a red X. And
I say, OK, well, dang.

00:18:22.560 --> 00:18:26.130
So here they have to get it
right in order to complete it,

00:18:26.130 --> 00:18:28.503
but we tell them right
away that it's not right.

00:18:28.503 --> 00:18:29.670
And they keep working on it.

00:18:29.670 --> 00:18:31.900
Or they post on Piazza.

00:18:31.900 --> 00:18:33.510
My circuit doesn't work.

00:18:33.510 --> 00:18:36.030
The staff can pull it up
remotely from the server,

00:18:36.030 --> 00:18:39.900
and say, oh, here's where--
here's your mistake.

00:18:39.900 --> 00:18:43.800
So the idea is that the students
are actually being engineers.

00:18:43.800 --> 00:18:48.360
This may be one of the first
actual build-it experiences

00:18:48.360 --> 00:18:49.590
they have.

00:18:49.590 --> 00:18:52.760
Again, these are
sophomores, right?

00:18:52.760 --> 00:18:55.295
So it's a little bit
of fun to say, well,

00:18:55.295 --> 00:18:56.170
this is sort of neat.

00:18:59.200 --> 00:19:02.610
I've actually put together
the circuit and debugged it.

00:19:02.610 --> 00:19:04.230
So I had to say,
well, what was wrong?

00:19:04.230 --> 00:19:05.130
I got a wrong thing.

00:19:05.130 --> 00:19:06.330
What did I do wrong?

00:19:06.330 --> 00:19:07.630
And then fix it.

00:19:07.630 --> 00:19:10.080
So that's a very
valuable experience.

00:19:10.080 --> 00:19:11.940
So it's one thing.

00:19:11.940 --> 00:19:14.320
It's like the late
night TV salesman.

00:19:14.320 --> 00:19:15.600
When you watch them, use it.

00:19:15.600 --> 00:19:16.560
It's so easy.

00:19:16.560 --> 00:19:17.440
SARAH HANSEN: Right.

00:19:17.440 --> 00:19:19.440
CHRISTOPHER TERMAN: But
you get the widget home.

00:19:19.440 --> 00:19:20.677
And it doesn't work.

00:19:20.677 --> 00:19:22.510
And so that's-- they've
seen it in lectures.

00:19:22.510 --> 00:19:23.880
They've seen it on the videos.

00:19:23.880 --> 00:19:26.640
They've seen it the
worked examples.

00:19:26.640 --> 00:19:30.180
And it's all extremely obvious
that this is straightforward

00:19:30.180 --> 00:19:31.410
until you do it yourself.

00:19:31.410 --> 00:19:33.030
And then you fill
in all the pieces,

00:19:33.030 --> 00:19:37.110
that you were just being,
oh, how hard could that be?

00:19:37.110 --> 00:19:38.207
Oh, now I know.

00:19:38.207 --> 00:19:39.040
SARAH HANSEN: Right.

00:19:39.040 --> 00:19:41.540
CHRISTOPHER TERMAN: So they
work hard at trying to fix that.

00:19:41.540 --> 00:19:43.980
And I think the whole idea
of these virtual lab benches

00:19:43.980 --> 00:19:46.740
is great.

00:19:46.740 --> 00:19:49.290
As I said, the
execution environment

00:19:49.290 --> 00:19:52.890
and the graphics environment
on the browser is first rate.

00:19:52.890 --> 00:19:56.250
It's very easy to build
sophisticated tools that

00:19:56.250 --> 00:20:00.340
use reasonably complex
calculations in the background

00:20:00.340 --> 00:20:03.810
and have a really
great user interface.

00:20:03.810 --> 00:20:06.920
And the browser is portable.

00:20:06.920 --> 00:20:09.270
So 20 years ago I
gave you software

00:20:09.270 --> 00:20:12.760
to download on your
computer to do this stuff.

00:20:12.760 --> 00:20:13.890
The landmine that was.

00:20:13.890 --> 00:20:15.580
Everybody's environment
was a little different.

00:20:15.580 --> 00:20:17.540
Oh, you don't have the latest
version of that library?

00:20:17.540 --> 00:20:18.582
Well, you can't run this.

00:20:18.582 --> 00:20:22.080
But if you update your
library, you can't run that.

00:20:22.080 --> 00:20:23.920
It was really a nightmare.

00:20:23.920 --> 00:20:29.280
So packaging things--
packaging up these lab

00:20:29.280 --> 00:20:31.320
experiences in a way
that they can be used

00:20:31.320 --> 00:20:34.590
by people around the world.

00:20:34.590 --> 00:20:35.370
So here I was.

00:20:35.370 --> 00:20:38.940
I was riding on the
Hong Kong subway.

00:20:38.940 --> 00:20:43.510
And some young adult
comes up to me and says,

00:20:43.510 --> 00:20:44.575
I took your MITx course.

00:20:44.575 --> 00:20:45.450
SARAH HANSEN: Really?

00:20:45.450 --> 00:20:47.490
CHRISTOPHER TERMAN: And I really
loved doing the circuit stuff.

00:20:47.490 --> 00:20:49.115
And I didn't have to
download anything.

00:20:49.115 --> 00:20:50.700
And I'm sort of going, wow.

00:20:50.700 --> 00:20:51.510
I mean, this is--

00:20:51.510 --> 00:20:52.760
SARAH HANSEN: It's incredible.

00:20:52.760 --> 00:20:53.843
CHRISTOPHER TERMAN: It is.

00:20:53.843 --> 00:20:55.960
It's interesting to
be stopped by people.

00:20:55.960 --> 00:20:56.793
SARAH HANSEN: Right.

00:20:56.793 --> 00:20:58.210
CHRISTOPHER TERMAN:
And they start

00:20:58.210 --> 00:21:00.900
talking about how this was
more than just a listening

00:21:00.900 --> 00:21:01.440
experience.

00:21:01.440 --> 00:21:07.320
So these virtual labs actually
go from being something that--

00:21:07.320 --> 00:21:09.510
I mean, it takes courses
from being a listening

00:21:09.510 --> 00:21:15.030
experience with maybe some
pencil P-sets to your hands

00:21:15.030 --> 00:21:16.200
are active.

00:21:16.200 --> 00:21:18.780
So hands-on, brain on, right?

00:21:18.780 --> 00:21:22.720
And when people's brains
turn on, it's amazing what--

00:21:22.720 --> 00:21:23.970
they remember it.

00:21:23.970 --> 00:21:26.600
SARAH HANSEN: Right.

00:21:26.600 --> 00:21:29.300
So what kind of
challenges do students

00:21:29.300 --> 00:21:33.050
encounter when they're trying
their hand at being engineers

00:21:33.050 --> 00:21:35.240
for the first time?

00:21:35.240 --> 00:21:38.030
Is there anything that tends
to pop up again and again?

00:21:41.800 --> 00:21:44.300
CHRISTOPHER TERMAN: So
I think a lot of this

00:21:44.300 --> 00:21:46.980
is sort of competence.

00:21:46.980 --> 00:21:52.988
So people sometimes-- the
students come to me, and say,

00:21:52.988 --> 00:21:54.030
I want to make this work.

00:21:54.030 --> 00:21:56.180
And I say, OK, let me
look at your design.

00:21:56.180 --> 00:21:57.230
Let's fix it.

00:21:57.230 --> 00:21:58.010
And I go through.

00:21:58.010 --> 00:22:01.490
And I try to keep my
hands in my pockets

00:22:01.490 --> 00:22:02.930
and let them do the fixing.

00:22:02.930 --> 00:22:05.100
But I say, have you
thought about this?

00:22:05.100 --> 00:22:07.790
If this works and that doesn't,
what does that tell you?

00:22:07.790 --> 00:22:11.090
So a lot of students
aren't very good at taking

00:22:11.090 --> 00:22:13.460
the information they
do know and using

00:22:13.460 --> 00:22:15.720
it to deduce the
next thing to try

00:22:15.720 --> 00:22:18.080
or the next thing to
test and to narrow down

00:22:18.080 --> 00:22:19.310
where the problem is.

00:22:19.310 --> 00:22:21.140
So there's a real--
there's a learning--

00:22:21.140 --> 00:22:24.050
something you have to learn how
to do is to be organized about

00:22:24.050 --> 00:22:28.710
how taking something
that isn't working--

00:22:28.710 --> 00:22:30.860
or complicated things, so
parts of it are working,

00:22:30.860 --> 00:22:32.150
but something isn't.

00:22:32.150 --> 00:22:34.190
And trying to work
back from both

00:22:34.190 --> 00:22:36.830
ends to somewhere in the
middle that doesn't work.

00:22:36.830 --> 00:22:40.460
And so that's a skill that you
have to practice for a while.

00:22:40.460 --> 00:22:43.940
And we try to help
with that skill.

00:22:43.940 --> 00:22:46.070
I have a lot of
confidence that will work.

00:22:46.070 --> 00:22:48.920
Most students are pretty
convinced that either

00:22:48.920 --> 00:22:52.075
the simulator is
broken or is hopeless.

00:22:52.075 --> 00:22:53.450
And so they're
somewhat surprised

00:22:53.450 --> 00:22:56.450
to realize that there
is a systematic way

00:22:56.450 --> 00:22:58.100
to make something that works.

00:22:58.100 --> 00:23:03.950
And once they are convinced
that that's actually true,

00:23:03.950 --> 00:23:06.740
they are getting more confident
that, oh, it doesn't work now,

00:23:06.740 --> 00:23:09.890
but I'll just work on it for 10
minutes, and I'm sure it will.

00:23:09.890 --> 00:23:12.620
As opposed to just saying,
oh, the only thing I can do

00:23:12.620 --> 00:23:14.660
is to raise my hand and
say, could you help me?

00:23:14.660 --> 00:23:16.160
Because it isn't working.

00:23:16.160 --> 00:23:17.720
So we try to get
the students out

00:23:17.720 --> 00:23:20.840
of, look, your job is to
actually make it work,

00:23:20.840 --> 00:23:24.877
not to merely ask us to come
over and watch us make it work.

00:23:24.877 --> 00:23:25.710
SARAH HANSEN: Right.

00:23:25.710 --> 00:23:28.628
CHRISTOPHER TERMAN: And so
students make that transition

00:23:28.628 --> 00:23:29.420
through the course.

00:23:29.420 --> 00:23:30.230
SARAH HANSEN: So it seems--

00:23:30.230 --> 00:23:31.500
CHRISTOPHER TERMAN: The
course of the course.

00:23:31.500 --> 00:23:32.333
SARAH HANSEN: Right.

00:23:32.333 --> 00:23:34.310
So it seems like a
learning goal in the course

00:23:34.310 --> 00:23:37.050
is not only learning
the architecture

00:23:37.050 --> 00:23:40.100
of digital systems,
but also developing

00:23:40.100 --> 00:23:43.520
professional competencies
in the sense of attitudes

00:23:43.520 --> 00:23:44.487
that engineers embrace.

00:23:44.487 --> 00:23:45.570
CHRISTOPHER TERMAN: Right.

00:23:45.570 --> 00:23:47.840
There's a bunch of processes
that you have to go through.

00:23:47.840 --> 00:23:48.100
SARAH HANSEN: Processes.

00:23:48.100 --> 00:23:50.450
CHRISTOPHER TERMAN: And the same
thing is true of all learning.

00:23:50.450 --> 00:23:51.980
Learning how to
learn is something

00:23:51.980 --> 00:23:54.290
that sophomores are still doing.

00:23:54.290 --> 00:23:57.860
And so this is
probably the first time

00:23:57.860 --> 00:24:01.520
that they've been sort of
thrown into the deep end.

00:24:01.520 --> 00:24:04.940
We try to have lots of
lifeguards standing by.

00:24:04.940 --> 00:24:07.040
But we're prepared
to do more than just

00:24:07.040 --> 00:24:09.630
check off on our
clipboard, sink or swim.

00:24:09.630 --> 00:24:13.380
I mean, we're ready to dive
in, and say, OK, try this.

00:24:13.380 --> 00:24:14.900
Try that.

00:24:14.900 --> 00:24:19.760
It's actually pretty helpful
to have an experience like this

00:24:19.760 --> 00:24:22.610
after your freshman year, which
has a lot of training wheels,

00:24:22.610 --> 00:24:24.530
but before your
upper level classes

00:24:24.530 --> 00:24:29.020
where help is a little thin.

00:24:29.020 --> 00:24:30.830
SARAH HANSEN: Right.

00:24:30.830 --> 00:24:33.590
CHRISTOPHER TERMAN: One of the
great things about 004 is that

00:24:33.590 --> 00:24:37.170
half the people on your
hall have taken this course.

00:24:37.170 --> 00:24:40.250
And so even though we
have our core staff,

00:24:40.250 --> 00:24:42.560
you can go down your
hall, and as I say,

00:24:42.560 --> 00:24:45.230
every other person will
say, oh, I took the course.

00:24:45.230 --> 00:24:48.050
So there's actually
an enormous body

00:24:48.050 --> 00:24:51.050
of knowledge about the
material and things like that.

00:24:51.050 --> 00:24:56.720
So not many courses
have that opportunity,

00:24:56.720 --> 00:24:58.630
but we take great
advantage of it.

00:24:58.630 --> 00:25:01.820
So there's a lot of sort
of hallway learning,

00:25:01.820 --> 00:25:03.830
peer learning that
happens outside

00:25:03.830 --> 00:25:05.270
of the sort of
structured learning

00:25:05.270 --> 00:25:06.565
that we do in the class.

00:25:06.565 --> 00:25:07.940
SARAH HANSEN:
That's fascinating.

00:25:07.940 --> 00:25:09.560
It kind of speaks
to the importance

00:25:09.560 --> 00:25:12.140
of having common
learning experiences

00:25:12.140 --> 00:25:14.750
at the undergraduate
level just to facilitate

00:25:14.750 --> 00:25:17.120
that sort of, like you
said, hallway learning.

00:25:17.120 --> 00:25:18.200
It's really interesting.

00:25:18.200 --> 00:25:20.158
CHRISTOPHER TERMAN: Well,
plus students often--

00:25:20.158 --> 00:25:21.660
during the day, it's hectic.

00:25:21.660 --> 00:25:21.920
SARAH HANSEN: Yes.

00:25:21.920 --> 00:25:23.300
CHRISTOPHER TERMAN:
They're distracted.

00:25:23.300 --> 00:25:24.410
They come to lecture.

00:25:24.410 --> 00:25:27.050
They have lots of
things on their minds.

00:25:27.050 --> 00:25:30.110
So mostly it's being in
the quiet of their room

00:25:30.110 --> 00:25:32.750
that they probably
intellectually really

00:25:32.750 --> 00:25:34.190
grapple with the material.

00:25:34.190 --> 00:25:38.630
So first of all, giving them
things to grapple with is good,

00:25:38.630 --> 00:25:41.600
but then making sure they're
supported, either through peers

00:25:41.600 --> 00:25:43.970
or through the Piazza forum.

00:25:43.970 --> 00:25:47.566
When they're outside of the sort
of structured help we provide.

00:25:47.566 --> 00:25:48.520
SARAH HANSEN: Right.

00:25:48.520 --> 00:25:49.937
CHRISTOPHER TERMAN:
It's really, I

00:25:49.937 --> 00:25:52.370
think, changed how the
students consume the course.

00:25:52.370 --> 00:25:59.030
And so the lecture
attendance is modest.

00:25:59.030 --> 00:26:04.100
But a lot of people do very
well on learning the material

00:26:04.100 --> 00:26:04.892
on the assessments.

00:26:04.892 --> 00:26:05.725
SARAH HANSEN: Right.

00:26:05.725 --> 00:26:07.250
I mean, I think
that speaks to what

00:26:07.250 --> 00:26:10.520
you talked about earlier in
that you offer a buffet of ways

00:26:10.520 --> 00:26:11.240
to learn.

00:26:11.240 --> 00:26:13.240
And so people who
come to the lectures

00:26:13.240 --> 00:26:16.967
are the people who learn
best through that format.

00:26:16.967 --> 00:26:18.050
CHRISTOPHER TERMAN: Right.

00:26:18.050 --> 00:26:20.720
And some people I never see
except occasionally they'll

00:26:20.720 --> 00:26:22.150
come when I have lab hours.

00:26:22.150 --> 00:26:24.650
They'll come by, because they
just want to chit chat, right?

00:26:24.650 --> 00:26:25.483
SARAH HANSEN: Right.

00:26:25.483 --> 00:26:27.260
CHRISTOPHER TERMAN: We have--

00:26:27.260 --> 00:26:29.600
one of the activities you
do after you do the design,

00:26:29.600 --> 00:26:30.650
we have a check-off.

00:26:30.650 --> 00:26:34.850
So you have to come and
sort of explain your design.

00:26:34.850 --> 00:26:37.940
Partly that's just to make
sure that maybe you actually

00:26:37.940 --> 00:26:40.947
did the design instead of
your friend down the hall.

00:26:40.947 --> 00:26:41.780
SARAH HANSEN: I see.

00:26:41.780 --> 00:26:43.613
CHRISTOPHER TERMAN: And
so at the very least

00:26:43.613 --> 00:26:45.280
we want them to
understand the design

00:26:45.280 --> 00:26:46.572
that they claim they have done.

00:26:46.572 --> 00:26:47.763
SARAH HANSEN: Right.

00:26:47.763 --> 00:26:49.180
CHRISTOPHER TERMAN:
But for people

00:26:49.180 --> 00:26:51.010
who have worked hard
on it, it's an opp--

00:26:51.010 --> 00:26:53.380
they love to come
by and show it off.

00:26:53.380 --> 00:26:55.900
And so they're proud
of their baby, right?

00:26:55.900 --> 00:26:57.670
I mean, particularly
towards the end

00:26:57.670 --> 00:27:01.240
of the course when we have
a fairly complex design

00:27:01.240 --> 00:27:05.260
project, which is actually very
hard to get very high marks on.

00:27:05.260 --> 00:27:07.280
I mean, you have to be
really good to get it.

00:27:07.280 --> 00:27:11.050
And so it's an amazing number
of people who tackle that.

00:27:11.050 --> 00:27:12.160
And they come in.

00:27:12.160 --> 00:27:14.120
And they say, OK,
I'm stuck here.

00:27:14.120 --> 00:27:16.210
Give me some ideas
what to try next.

00:27:16.210 --> 00:27:20.460
And if you dare try to
say, well, just do this.

00:27:20.460 --> 00:27:22.030
I don't want the answer.

00:27:22.030 --> 00:27:23.650
I want you to--

00:27:23.650 --> 00:27:24.870
I'm having fun here.

00:27:24.870 --> 00:27:26.288
So don't take away the fun part.

00:27:26.288 --> 00:27:27.580
I want to puzzle it out myself.

00:27:27.580 --> 00:27:29.020
I just need some
hints as to where

00:27:29.020 --> 00:27:31.445
my puzzler should be focusing.

00:27:31.445 --> 00:27:33.070
SARAH HANSEN: The
fun is in the puzzle.

00:27:33.070 --> 00:27:34.153
CHRISTOPHER TERMAN: It is.

00:27:34.153 --> 00:27:35.410
It is, and the doing of it.

00:27:35.410 --> 00:27:37.755
SARAH HANSEN: And
the doing of it.

00:27:37.755 --> 00:27:39.630
CHRISTOPHER TERMAN: And
I think that's great,

00:27:39.630 --> 00:27:42.180
because when
students first come,

00:27:42.180 --> 00:27:44.250
they tend to be
focusing on the answers.

00:27:44.250 --> 00:27:47.220
Here you gave me a bunch of--
a worksheet full of questions.

00:27:47.220 --> 00:27:49.082
So I looked at the answers.

00:27:49.082 --> 00:27:50.040
I think I'm good to go.

00:27:50.040 --> 00:27:53.190
I say, no, the worksheets aren't
because we want you to know

00:27:53.190 --> 00:27:54.510
the answers to those questions.

00:27:54.510 --> 00:27:57.840
The worksheets are
to help you diagnose

00:27:57.840 --> 00:27:59.933
whether you understand things.

00:27:59.933 --> 00:28:02.100
So the best thing that can
happen with the worksheet

00:28:02.100 --> 00:28:04.620
is I don't know how
to do this problem.

00:28:04.620 --> 00:28:06.720
And so I should go
figure out how to do it.

00:28:06.720 --> 00:28:12.210
So if you're doing this
self-paced mastery learning

00:28:12.210 --> 00:28:17.730
shtick, which is sort of
how we try to help students

00:28:17.730 --> 00:28:23.850
master the material at their
own pace, whenever they want to.

00:28:23.850 --> 00:28:26.370
So we have to provide a
lot of self-assessments.

00:28:26.370 --> 00:28:28.580
They have to use them
as assessments, though.

00:28:28.580 --> 00:28:28.920
SARAH HANSEN: Right.

00:28:28.920 --> 00:28:29.580
CHRISTOPHER TERMAN:
They don't use them

00:28:29.580 --> 00:28:30.840
as assessments if
they're just saying,

00:28:30.840 --> 00:28:32.507
oh, the answer's three
to this question,

00:28:32.507 --> 00:28:34.590
and I hope they ask
this one on the quiz.

00:28:34.590 --> 00:28:35.797
They're not getting it.

00:28:35.797 --> 00:28:36.630
SARAH HANSEN: Right.

00:28:36.630 --> 00:28:37.290
CHRISTOPHER TERMAN:
Getting students

00:28:37.290 --> 00:28:39.660
to stop focusing on
the answers and really

00:28:39.660 --> 00:28:43.177
focus on, how do I tackle
this sort of problem?

00:28:43.177 --> 00:28:44.010
SARAH HANSEN: Right.

00:28:44.010 --> 00:28:45.210
CHRISTOPHER TERMAN: Of all
the things I know how to do,

00:28:45.210 --> 00:28:48.540
I first have to select the
appropriate concept or skill,

00:28:48.540 --> 00:28:50.580
and then I have to
know how to apply it.

00:28:50.580 --> 00:28:54.300
It's sort of neat to watch them
make the transition from coming

00:28:54.300 --> 00:28:58.770
in as sort of answer focused to
leaving sort of like, OK, you

00:28:58.770 --> 00:29:00.960
can ask me anything,
because I actually

00:29:00.960 --> 00:29:02.940
know how to do
things from scratch,

00:29:02.940 --> 00:29:08.610
not because I just
could pick something.

00:29:08.610 --> 00:29:11.490
I can not only recognize the
right answer when I see it.

00:29:11.490 --> 00:29:13.470
I can actually
make right answers.

00:29:13.470 --> 00:29:15.810
That's a very--
people feel empowered

00:29:15.810 --> 00:29:19.020
when they can do that.

00:29:19.020 --> 00:29:21.330
SARAH HANSEN: Let's talk
a bit about the future.

00:29:21.330 --> 00:29:24.030
It seems like the courses
is finely tuned already.

00:29:24.030 --> 00:29:26.010
But do you have
ideas for how you

00:29:26.010 --> 00:29:28.413
might tweak it in the future?

00:29:28.413 --> 00:29:30.580
CHRISTOPHER TERMAN: Well,
I'm retiring in two weeks.

00:29:30.580 --> 00:29:32.175
SARAH HANSEN: Oh, so not you.

00:29:32.175 --> 00:29:34.050
CHRISTOPHER TERMAN: So
it's being turned over

00:29:34.050 --> 00:29:34.860
to a new team.

00:29:34.860 --> 00:29:37.470
Some of the people who were
part of the teaching cadre

00:29:37.470 --> 00:29:40.440
earlier are taking it over.

00:29:40.440 --> 00:29:42.840
They, of course, have
their own strong opinions

00:29:42.840 --> 00:29:45.160
about better ways
of doing things.

00:29:45.160 --> 00:29:47.640
So I think that the basic
structure of the course

00:29:47.640 --> 00:29:51.270
will be the same, the basic list
of topics that will be taught.

00:29:51.270 --> 00:29:54.030
But they have a different sort
of design experience in mind.

00:29:54.030 --> 00:29:57.750
So they'll find their own way.

00:29:57.750 --> 00:30:00.240
It's interesting to
me because I think

00:30:00.240 --> 00:30:03.640
until you've taught
a 300-person course,

00:30:03.640 --> 00:30:06.300
you may not appreciate how
things which work really

00:30:06.300 --> 00:30:08.760
well with two students
in your office

00:30:08.760 --> 00:30:12.420
or 10 students in a
recitation doesn't really

00:30:12.420 --> 00:30:14.073
work for 300 students.

00:30:14.073 --> 00:30:15.990
You suddenly say, well,
they'll ask a question

00:30:15.990 --> 00:30:16.698
if they have one.

00:30:16.698 --> 00:30:18.930
So I don't need to
be too specific.

00:30:18.930 --> 00:30:22.830
It's sort of interesting to
say, whoa, 300 questions.

00:30:22.830 --> 00:30:24.030
That's a lot of questions.

00:30:24.030 --> 00:30:25.770
And three of them
from every student.

00:30:25.770 --> 00:30:28.060
So I have 1,000
questions this week.

00:30:28.060 --> 00:30:31.290
And so you start learning
how carefully the materials

00:30:31.290 --> 00:30:32.160
have to be prepared.

00:30:34.950 --> 00:30:36.700
In one of the
questions you sent me,

00:30:36.700 --> 00:30:40.680
you talked about
engineering the materials.

00:30:40.680 --> 00:30:44.460
And a big class has a real
issue with engineering materials

00:30:44.460 --> 00:30:49.440
that will help get
students to do the things

00:30:49.440 --> 00:30:53.400
you want them to do, but
you can't leave them adrift,

00:30:53.400 --> 00:30:56.160
because you only
have so much capacity

00:30:56.160 --> 00:30:58.350
to pull them all back to shore.

00:30:58.350 --> 00:31:00.960
And so you really have
to put most of what

00:31:00.960 --> 00:31:02.740
they need into the materials.

00:31:02.740 --> 00:31:05.220
SARAH HANSEN: Right.

00:31:05.220 --> 00:31:08.700
Can you say more about
engineering the materials

00:31:08.700 --> 00:31:10.838
to keep everyone afloat?

00:31:10.838 --> 00:31:13.130
CHRISTOPHER TERMAN: Well, so
it's an iterative process.

00:31:13.130 --> 00:31:17.570
I mean, people say, oh,
004, it runs like clockwork.

00:31:17.570 --> 00:31:19.700
This is the best organized
course I've ever had.

00:31:19.700 --> 00:31:24.500
And I say, well, 20 years ago
you wouldn't have said that.

00:31:24.500 --> 00:31:26.875
We've had our share of
unfortunate assignments,

00:31:26.875 --> 00:31:29.150
or undoable assignments,
or assignments

00:31:29.150 --> 00:31:32.270
that were just too hard for
some students, or too easy

00:31:32.270 --> 00:31:33.380
for everybody.

00:31:33.380 --> 00:31:35.540
And so yes, we do that.

00:31:35.540 --> 00:31:38.708
We try to get student feedback.

00:31:38.708 --> 00:31:40.250
The forum is actually
great for that.

00:31:40.250 --> 00:31:42.180
You get instant feedback on--

00:31:42.180 --> 00:31:42.680
this sucked.

00:31:42.680 --> 00:31:45.700
And you're going, OK, OK.

00:31:45.700 --> 00:31:47.630
And so if you're
good, you make notes.

00:31:47.630 --> 00:31:48.467
SARAH HANSEN: OK.

00:31:48.467 --> 00:31:50.675
CHRISTOPHER TERMAN: I think
I've taught this course--

00:31:53.720 --> 00:31:55.100
I don't know--

00:31:55.100 --> 00:31:55.880
30 semesters.

00:31:55.880 --> 00:31:56.630
SARAH HANSEN: Wow.

00:31:56.630 --> 00:31:59.047
CHRISTOPHER TERMAN: So that
gives you a lot of opportunity

00:31:59.047 --> 00:32:00.153
to think--

00:32:00.153 --> 00:32:02.070
reflect at the end of
each semester about what

00:32:02.070 --> 00:32:03.600
went right, what went wrong.

00:32:03.600 --> 00:32:06.300
With a good staff, they're
usually on top of it.

00:32:06.300 --> 00:32:09.810
Oh, we've got to change this,
or I spent too much time

00:32:09.810 --> 00:32:11.660
helping students with this.

00:32:11.660 --> 00:32:14.490
And even in real-time
we'll add a paragraph

00:32:14.490 --> 00:32:18.180
to the assignment saying, oh,
a little bit more explanation,

00:32:18.180 --> 00:32:19.027
or a hint.

00:32:19.027 --> 00:32:19.860
SARAH HANSEN: Right.

00:32:19.860 --> 00:32:24.110
CHRISTOPHER TERMAN: So a
willingness to sort of--

00:32:24.110 --> 00:32:26.070
and think of building
the materials

00:32:26.070 --> 00:32:28.630
as a continuous process.

00:32:28.630 --> 00:32:32.000
And after a while, most of
the potholes are filled in,

00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:33.850
and the drive is pretty smooth.

00:32:33.850 --> 00:32:35.795
SARAH HANSEN: Right.

00:32:35.795 --> 00:32:37.170
CHRISTOPHER TERMAN:
And sometimes

00:32:37.170 --> 00:32:40.830
the unexpected problem
is actually a doorway

00:32:40.830 --> 00:32:43.800
actually into a whole new thing.

00:32:43.800 --> 00:32:46.440
We have some students that
say, I thought about this,

00:32:46.440 --> 00:32:47.730
and I tried doing it this way.

00:32:47.730 --> 00:32:50.850
And I'm going, whoa, what
a great insight that is.

00:32:50.850 --> 00:32:53.710
And so we want all the students
to have that opportunity.

00:32:53.710 --> 00:32:55.210
So now we're going
to figure out how

00:32:55.210 --> 00:32:57.990
to build that into
the design problem

00:32:57.990 --> 00:33:01.820
so that everybody has an
opportunity to go aha.

00:33:01.820 --> 00:33:04.170
And it was really
neat that the students

00:33:04.170 --> 00:33:06.570
were able to come up
with that themselves.

00:33:06.570 --> 00:33:12.070
But that gives you a viewpoint.

00:33:12.070 --> 00:33:15.510
It gives you an opportunity
to understand how students

00:33:15.510 --> 00:33:17.670
are seeing what you're asking.

00:33:17.670 --> 00:33:20.170
They misunderstood, so they
answered a different question.

00:33:20.170 --> 00:33:23.470
And it turns out that
different question was at least

00:33:23.470 --> 00:33:26.170
as interesting, or maybe even
better than the one you asked.

00:33:26.170 --> 00:33:30.500
And so then you start one
of these virtual cycles.

00:33:30.500 --> 00:33:33.730
Then slowly you
build up stuff where

00:33:33.730 --> 00:33:37.480
you end up with questions
that are really--

00:33:37.480 --> 00:33:40.550
they don't look like
there's much to them,

00:33:40.550 --> 00:33:42.640
but there's been
a lot of evolution

00:33:42.640 --> 00:33:45.070
behind asking it just this way.

00:33:45.070 --> 00:33:46.270
SARAH HANSEN: Interesting.

00:33:46.270 --> 00:33:48.640
CHRISTOPHER TERMAN:
And just this order.

00:33:48.640 --> 00:33:51.220
So it's been fun to go
through that experience,

00:33:51.220 --> 00:33:52.630
and often surprising.

00:33:52.630 --> 00:33:55.773
And we go, oh, I
thought it was so clear.
