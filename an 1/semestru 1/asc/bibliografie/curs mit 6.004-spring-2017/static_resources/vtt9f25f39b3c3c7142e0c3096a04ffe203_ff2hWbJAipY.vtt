00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:02.900
Okay, we're done!

00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:07.689
Here's the final datapath for executing instructions
and handling exceptions.

00:00:07.689 --> 00:00:12.580
Please take a moment to remind yourself of
what each datapath component does, i.e., why

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:14.820
it was added to the datapath.

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:20.450
Similarly, you should understand how the control
signals affect the operation of the datapath.

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:26.009
At least to my eye, this seems like a very
modest amount of hardware to achieve all this

00:00:26.009 --> 00:00:27.980
functionality!

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:32.141
It's so modest in fact, that will ask you
to actually complete the logic design for

00:00:32.141 --> 00:00:38.290
the Beta in an upcoming lab assignment :)
How does our design compare to the processor

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:42.320
you're using to view this course online?

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:46.830
Modern processors have many additional complexities
to increase performance:

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:52.970
pipelined execution, the ability to execute
more than instruction per cycle, fancier memory

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:57.480
systems to reduce average memory access time,
etc.

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:01.590
We'll cover some of these enhancements in
upcoming lectures.

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:08.670
The bottom line: the Beta hardware might occupy
1 or 2 sq mm on a modern integrated circuit,

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:15.260
while a modern Intel processor occupies 300
to 600 sq mm.

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:18.759
Clearly all that extra circuitry is there
for a reason!

00:01:18.759 --> 00:01:24.820
If you're curious, I'd recommend taking a
course on advanced processor architecture.

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:30.009
Here we've gathered up all the control signal
settings for each class of instructions, including

00:01:30.009 --> 00:01:34.340
the settings needed for exceptions and during
reset.

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:39.090
Wherever possible, we've specified "don't
care" for control signals whose value does

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:44.890
not affect the actions of the datapath needed
for a particular instruction.

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:50.210
Note that the memory write enable signal always
has a defined value, ensuring that we only

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:53.149
write to the memory during ST instructions.

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:59.069
Similarly, the write enable for the register
file is well-defined, except during RESET

00:01:59.069 --> 00:02:03.979
when presumably we're restarting the processor
and don't care about preserving any register

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:06.060
values.

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:11.360
As mentioned previously, a read-only memory
(ROM) indexed by the 6-bit opcode field is

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:16.680
the easiest way to generate the appropriate
control signals for the current instruction.

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:23.060
The Z and IRQ inputs to the control logic
will affect the control signals and this can

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:27.720
be accomplished with a small amount of logic
to process the ROM outputs.

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:32.920
One can always have fun with Karnuagh maps
to generate a minimal implementation using

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:34.950
ordinary logic gates.

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:40.060
The result will be much smaller, both in terms
of size and propagation delay, but requires

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:42.500
a lot more design work!

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:47.390
My recommendation: start with the ROM implementation
and get everything else working.

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:52.520
Then come back later when you feel like hacking
logic gates :)

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:57.340
So that's what it takes to design the hardware
for a simple 32-bit computer.

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:03.470
Of course, we made the job easy for ourselves
by choosing a simple binary encoding for our

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:10.340
instructions and limiting the hardware functionality
to efficiently executing the most common operations.

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:15.210
Less common and more complex functionality
can be left to software.

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:20.540
The exception mechanism gave us a powerful
tool for transferring control to software

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:23.840
when the hardware couldn't handle the task.

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:26.710
Have fun completing the hardware design of
your Beta.

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:29.570
Thousands of MIT students have enjoyed that
"Yes!"

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:33.510
moment when their design works for the first
time.

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:37.870
For their efforts we reward them with the
"Beta Inside" sticker you see here, which

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:41.620
you can see on laptops as you walk around
the Institute.

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:42.220
Good luck!
