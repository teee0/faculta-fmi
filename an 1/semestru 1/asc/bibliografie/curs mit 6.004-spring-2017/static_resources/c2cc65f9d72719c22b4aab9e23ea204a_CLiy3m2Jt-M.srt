1
00:00:00,650 --> 00:00:05,320
Let's make some measurements using one of
the simplest combinational devices: a buffer.

2
00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:10,469
A buffer has a single input and a single output,
where the output will be driven with the same

3
00:00:10,469 --> 00:00:15,659
digital value as the input after some small
propagation delay.

4
00:00:15,659 --> 00:00:20,580
This buffer obeys the static discipline - that's
what it means to be combinational - and uses

5
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:27,130
our revised signaling specification that includes
both low and high noise margins.

6
00:00:27,130 --> 00:00:31,470
The measurements will be made by setting the
input voltage to a sequence of values ranging

7
00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:35,450
from 0V up to the power supply voltage.

8
00:00:35,450 --> 00:00:39,590
After setting the input voltage to a particular
value, we'll wait for the output voltage to

9
00:00:39,590 --> 00:00:45,540
become stable, i.e., we'll wait for the propagation
delay of the buffer.

10
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:49,930
We'll plot the result on a graph with the
input voltage on the horizontal axis and the

11
00:00:49,930 --> 00:00:53,580
measured output voltage on the vertical axis.

12
00:00:53,580 --> 00:00:59,080
The resulting curve is called the voltage
transfer characteristic of the buffer.

13
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:05,019
For convenience, we've marked our signal thresholds
on the two axes.

14
00:01:05,019 --> 00:01:09,050
Before we start plotting points, note that
the static discipline constrains what the

15
00:01:09,050 --> 00:01:14,140
voltage transfer characteristic must look
like for any combinational device.

16
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:18,850
If we wait for the propagation delay of the
device, the measured output voltage must be

17
00:01:18,850 --> 00:01:24,890
a valid digital value if the input voltage
is a valid digital value - "valid in, valid

18
00:01:24,890 --> 00:01:27,470
out".

19
00:01:27,470 --> 00:01:32,600
We can show this graphically as shaded forbidden
regions on our graph.

20
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:37,620
Points in these regions correspond to valid
digital input voltages but invalid digital

21
00:01:37,620 --> 00:01:39,660
output voltages.

22
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:43,970
So if we're measuring a legal combinational
device, none of the points in its voltage

23
00:01:43,970 --> 00:01:46,940
transfer characteristic will fall within these
regions.

24
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:53,440
Okay, back to our buffer: setting the input
voltage to a value less than the low input

25
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:58,020
threshold V_IL, produces an output voltage
less than V_OL, as expected.

26
00:01:58,020 --> 00:02:05,170
A digital 0 input yields a digital 0 output.

27
00:02:05,170 --> 00:02:10,649
Trying a slightly higher but still valid 0
input gives a similar result.

28
00:02:10,649 --> 00:02:14,530
Note that these measurements don't tell us
anything about the speed of the buffer, they

29
00:02:14,530 --> 00:02:20,519
are just measuring the static behavior of
the device, not its dynamic behavior.

30
00:02:20,519 --> 00:02:24,900
If we proceed to make all the additional measurements,
we get the voltage transfer characteristic

31
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:29,560
of the buffer, shown as the black curve on
the graph.

32
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:34,099
Notice that the curve does not pass through
the shaded regions, meeting the expectations

33
00:02:34,099 --> 00:02:39,418
we set out above for the behavior of a legal
combinational device.

34
00:02:39,418 --> 00:02:43,810
There are two interesting observations to
be made about voltage transfer characteristics.

35
00:02:43,810 --> 00:02:48,730
Let's look more carefully at the white region
in the center of the graph, corresponding

36
00:02:48,730 --> 00:02:53,200
to input voltages in the range V_IL to V_IH.

37
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:58,189
First note that these input voltages are in
the forbidden zone of our signaling specification

38
00:02:58,189 --> 00:03:03,069
and so a combinational device can produce
any output voltage it likes and still obey

39
00:03:03,069 --> 00:03:09,349
the static discipline, which only constrains
the device's behavior for *valid* inputs.

40
00:03:09,349 --> 00:03:14,219
Second, note that the center white region
bounded by the four voltage thresholds is

41
00:03:14,219 --> 00:03:16,480
taller than it is wide.

42
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:22,719
This is true because our signaling specification
has positive noise margins, so V_OH - V_OL

43
00:03:22,719 --> 00:03:27,209
is strictly greater than V_IH - V_IL.

44
00:03:27,209 --> 00:03:31,920
Any curve passing through this region - as
the VTC must - has to have some portion where

45
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:36,129
the magnitude of the slope of the curve is
greater than 1.

46
00:03:36,129 --> 00:03:40,230
At the point where the magnitude of the slope
of the VTC is greater than one, note that

47
00:03:40,230 --> 00:03:46,249
a small change in the input voltage produces
a larger change in the output voltage.

48
00:03:46,249 --> 00:03:50,269
That's what it means when the magnitude of
the slope is greater than 1.

49
00:03:50,269 --> 00:03:55,560
In electrical terms, we would say the device
as a gain greater than 1 or less than -1,

50
00:03:55,560 --> 00:04:02,219
where we define gain as the change in output
voltage for a given change in input voltage.

51
00:04:02,219 --> 00:04:07,280
If we're considering building larger circuits
out of our combinational components, any output

52
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:10,709
can potentially be wired to some other input.

53
00:04:10,709 --> 00:04:16,529
This means the range on the horizontal axis
(V_IN) has to be the same as the range on

54
00:04:16,529 --> 00:04:24,139
the vertical axis (V_OUT), i.e., the graph
of VTC must be square and the VTC curve fits

55
00:04:24,139 --> 00:04:27,000
inside the square.

56
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:31,680
In order to fit within the square bounds,
the VTC must change slope at some point since

57
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:36,020
we know from above there must be regions where
the magnitude of the slope is greater than

58
00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:41,240
1 and it can't be greater than 1 across the
whole input range.

59
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:46,300
Devices that exhibit a change in gain across
their operating range are called nonlinear

60
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:48,770
devices.

61
00:04:48,770 --> 00:04:54,090
Together these observations tell us that we
cannot only use linear devices such as resistors,

62
00:04:54,090 --> 00:04:57,560
capacitors and inductors, to build combinational
devices.

63
00:04:57,560 --> 00:05:02,090
We'll need nonlinear devices with gain greater
than 1.

64
00:05:02,090 --> 00:05:05,180
Finding such devices is the subject of the
next chapter.
