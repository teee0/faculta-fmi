00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:03.830
Finally, our last instruction!

00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:08.050
Branches conditionally transfer control to
a specific target instruction.

00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:12.610
But we'll also need the ability to compute
the address of the target instruction - that

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:17.180
ability is provided by the JMP instruction
which simply sets the program counter to value

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:19.030
from register "ra".

00:00:19.030 --> 00:00:26.230
Like branches, JMP will write the PC+4 value
into to the specified destination register.

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:30.279
This capability is very useful for implementing
procedures in Beta code.

00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:35.140
Suppose we have a procedure "sqrt" that computes
the square root of its argument, which is

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:37.850
passed in, say, R0.

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:41.730
We don't show the code for sqrt on the right,
except for the last instruction, which is

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:43.390
a JMP.

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:47.750
On the left we see that the programmer wants
to call the sqrt procedure from two different

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:49.630
places in his program.

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:51.899
Let's watch what happens…

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:57.940
The first call to the sqrt procedure is implemented
by the unconditional branch at location 0x100

00:00:57.940 --> 00:00:59.570
in main memory.

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:03.950
The branch target is the first instruction
of the sqrt procedure, so execution continues

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:05.299
there.

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:13.729
The BEQ also writes the address of the following
instruction (0x104) into its destination register,

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:14.810
R28.

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:20.070
When we reach the end of first procedure call,
the JMP instruction loads the value in R28,

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:26.229
which is 0x104, into the PC, so execution
continues with the instruction following the

00:01:26.229 --> 00:01:28.170
first BEQ.

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:32.920
So we've managed to return from the procedure
and continue execution where we left off in

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:35.219
the main program.

00:01:35.219 --> 00:01:39.669
When we get to the second call to the sqrt
procedure, the sequence of events is the same

00:01:39.669 --> 00:01:47.439
as before except that this time R28 contains
0x67C, the address of the instruction following

00:01:47.439 --> 00:01:49.630
the second BEQ.

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:55.759
So the second time we reach the end of the
sqrt procedure, the JMP sets the PC to 0x67C

00:01:55.759 --> 00:02:01.079
and execution resumes with the instruction
following the second procedure call.

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:02.299
Neat!

00:02:02.299 --> 00:02:06.439
The BEQs and JMP have worked together to implement
procedure call and return.

00:02:06.439 --> 00:02:12.349
We'll discuss the implementation of procedures
in detail in an upcoming lecture.

00:02:12.349 --> 00:02:15.549
That wraps up the design of the Beta instruction
set architecture.

00:02:15.549 --> 00:02:21.000
In summary, the Beta has 32 registers to hold
values that can be used as operands for the

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.390
ALU.

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:27.390
All other values, along with the binary representation
of the program itself, are stored in main

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:28.960
memory.

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:35.769
The Beta supports 32-bit memory addresses
and can access values in 2^32 = 4 gigabytes

00:02:35.769 --> 00:02:37.890
of main memory.

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:43.489
All Beta memory access refer to 32-bit words,
so all addresses will be a multiple of 4 since

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:44.540
there are 4 bytes/word.

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:48.890
The are two instruction formats.

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:53.920
The first specifies an opcode, two source
registers and a destination register.

00:02:53.920 --> 00:03:00.090
The second replaces the second source register
with a 32-bit constant, derived by sign-extending

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:04.239
a 16-bit constant stored in the instruction
itself.

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:09.120
There are three classes of instructions:
ALU operations, LD and ST for accessing main

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:13.840
memory, and branches and JMPs that change
the order of execution.

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:15.099
And that's it!

00:03:15.099 --> 00:03:19.510
As we'll see in the next lecture, we'll be
able parlay this relatively simple repertoire

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:24.209
of operations into a system that can execute
any computation we can specify.
