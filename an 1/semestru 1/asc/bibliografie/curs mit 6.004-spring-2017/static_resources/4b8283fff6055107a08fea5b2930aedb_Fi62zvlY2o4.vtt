00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:02.940
Now we get to the fun part!

00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:07.990
To build other logic gates, we'll design complementary
pullup and pulldown circuits, hooked up as

00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:12.760
shown in the diagram on the right, to control
the voltage of the output node.

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:17.449
"Complementary" refers to property that when
one of the circuits is conducting, the other

00:00:17.449 --> 00:00:19.589
is not.

00:00:19.589 --> 00:00:24.169
When the pullup circuit is conducting and
the pulldown circuit is not, the output node

00:00:24.169 --> 00:00:30.009
has a connection to V_DD and its output voltage
will quickly rise to become a valid digital

00:00:30.009 --> 00:00:31.779
1 output.

00:00:31.779 --> 00:00:36.790
Similarly, when the pulldown circuit is conducting
and the pullup is not, the output node has

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:41.309
a connection to GROUND and its output voltage
will quickly fall to become a valid digital

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:43.739
0 output.

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:47.730
If the circuits are incorrectly designed so
that they are not complementary and could

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:53.600
both be conducting for an extended period
of time, there's a path between V_DD and GROUND

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:58.390
and large amounts of short circuit current
will flow, a very bad idea.

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:02.699
Since our simple switch model won't let us
determine the output voltage in this case,

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:06.780
we'll call this output value "X" or unknown.

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:12.470
Another possibility with a non-complementary
pullup and pulldown is that neither is conducting

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:16.080
and the output node has no connection to either
power supply voltage.

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:21.020
At this point, the output node is electrically
floating and whatever charge is stored by

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:25.210
the nodal capacitance will stay there, at
least for a while.

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:30.560
This is a form of memory and we'll come back
to this in a couple of lectures.

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:34.770
For now, we'll concentrate on the behavior
of devices with complementary pullups and

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:37.189
pulldowns.

00:01:37.189 --> 00:01:41.899
Since the pullup and pulldown circuits are
complementary, we'll see there's a nice symmetry

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:43.689
in their design.

00:01:43.689 --> 00:01:48.689
We've already seen the simplest complementary
circuit: a single NFET pulldown and a single

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:50.729
PFET pullup.

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:55.640
If the same signal controls both switches,
it's easy to see that when one switch is on,

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:58.700
the other switch is off.

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:03.759
Now consider a pulldown circuit consisting
of two NFET switches in series.

00:02:03.759 --> 00:02:08.470
There's a connection through both switches
when A is 1 and B is 1.

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:13.750
For any other combination of A and B values,
one or the other of the switches (or both!)

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:15.890
will be off.

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:21.790
The complementary circuit to NFET switches
in series is PFET switches in parallel.

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:26.390
There's a connection between the top and bottom
circuit nodes when either of the PFET switches

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:31.980
is on, i.e., when A is 0 or B is 0.

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:40.440
As a thought experiment consider all possible
pairs of values for A and B: 00, 01, 10, and

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:42.090
11.

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:48.400
When one or both of the inputs is 0, the series
NFET circuit is not conducting and parallel

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:50.470
PFET circuit is.

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:56.370
And when both inputs are 1, the series NFET
circuit is conducting but the parallel PFET

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:59.500
circuit is not.

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:04.540
Finally consider the case where we have parallel
NFETs and series PFETs.

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:07.900
Conduct the same thought experiment as above
to convince yourself that when one of the

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:11.600
circuits is conducting the other isn't.

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:17.090
Let's put these observations to work when
building our next CMOS combinational device.

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:23.370
In this device, we're using series NFETs in
the pulldown and parallel PFETs in the pullup,

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:28.320
circuits that we convinced ourselves were
complementary in the previous slide.

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:32.990
We can build a tabular representation, called
a truth table, that describes the value of

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:38.450
Z for all possible combinations of the input
values for A and B.

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:45.311
When A and B are 0, the PFETs are on and the
NFETs are off, so Z is connected to V_DD and

00:03:45.311 --> 00:03:48.040
the output of the device is a digital 1.

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:54.100
In fact, if either A or B is 0 [CLICK, CLICK]
that continues to be the case, and the value

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:56.540
of Z is still 1.

00:03:56.540 --> 00:04:01.790
Only when both A and B are 1 [CLICK], will
both NFETs be on and the value of Z become

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:03.120
0.

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:08.140
This particular device is called a NAND gate,
short for "NOT-AND", a function that is the

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:11.620
inverse of the AND function.

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:16.100
Returning to a physical view for a moment,
the figure on the left is a bird's eye view,

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:20.370
looking down on the surface of the integrated
circuit, showing how the MOSFETs are laid

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:22.350
out in two dimensions.

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:27.969
The blue material represents metal wires with
large top and bottom metal runs connecting

00:04:27.969 --> 00:04:30.550
to V_DD and GROUND.

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:35.900
The red material forms the polysilicon gate
nodes, the green material the n-type source/drain

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:40.930
diffusions for the NFETs and the tan material
the p-type source/drain diffusions for the

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:41.930
PFETs.

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:48.210
Can you see that the NFETs are connected in
series and the PFETs in parallel?

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:54.439
Just to give you a sense of the costs of making
a single NAND gate, the yellow box is a back-of-the-envelope

00:04:54.439 --> 00:05:00.690
calculation showing that we can manufacture
approximately 26 billion NAND gates on a single

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:07.620
300mm (that's 12 inches for us non-metric
folks) silicon wafer.

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:13.800
For the older IC manufacturing process shown
here, it costs about $3500 to buy the materials

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:19.710
and perform the manufacturing steps needed
to form the circuitry for all those NAND gates.

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:23.849
So the final cost is a bit more than 100 nano-dollars
per NAND gate.

00:05:23.849 --> 00:05:26.830
I think this qualifies as both cheap and small!
