00:00:01.069 --> 00:00:05.819
Now that we have some sense about how MOSFETs
function, let's use them to build circuits

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:09.270
to process our digitally encoded information.

00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:14.249
We have two simple rules we'll use when building
the circuits, which, if they're followed,

00:00:14.249 --> 00:00:19.310
will allow us to abstract the behavior of
the MOSFET as a simple voltage-controlled

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:20.900
switch.

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:27.020
The first rule is that we'll only use n-channel
MOSFETs, which we'll call NFETs for short,

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:31.259
when building pulldown circuits that connect
a signaling node to the GROUND rail of the

00:00:31.259 --> 00:00:33.140
power supply.

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:38.540
When the pulldown circuit is conducting, the
signaling node will be at 0V and qualify as

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:41.600
the digital value "0".

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:47.059
If we obey this rule, NFETs will act switches
controlled by V_GS, the difference between

00:00:47.059 --> 00:00:50.620
the voltage of the gate terminal and the voltage
of the source terminal.

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:56.670
When V_GS is lower than the MOSFET's threshold
voltage, the switch is "open" or not conducting

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:01.850
and there is no connection between the MOSFET's
source and drain terminals.

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:07.010
If V_GS is greater than the threshold voltage,
the switch is "on" or conducting and there

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:10.280
is a connection between the source and drain
terminals.

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:14.510
That path has a resistance determined by the
magnitude of V_GS.

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:18.950
The larger V_GS, the lower the effective resistance
of the switch and the more current that will

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:21.658
flow from drain to source.

00:01:21.658 --> 00:01:26.729
When designing pulldown circuits of NFET switches,
we can use the following simple mental model

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:31.590
for each NFET switch:
if the gate voltage is a digital 0, the switch

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:37.658
will be off; if the gate voltage is a digital
1, the switch will be on.

00:01:37.658 --> 00:01:43.619
The situation with PFET switches is analogous,
except that the potentials are reversed.

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:49.420
Our rule is that PFETs can only be used in
pullup circuits, used to connect a signaling

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:53.689
node to the power supply voltage, which we'll
call V_DD.

00:01:53.689 --> 00:01:58.189
When the pullup circuit is conducting, the
signaling node will be at V_DD volts and qualify

00:01:58.189 --> 00:02:02.409
as the digital value "1".

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:07.100
PFETs have a negative threshold voltage and
V_GS has to be less than the threshold voltage

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:10.000
in order for the PFET switch to be conducting.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.550
All these negatives can be a bit confusing,
but, happily there's a simple mental model

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:18.110
we can use for each PFET switch in the pullup
circuit:

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:23.480
if the gate voltage is a digital 0, the switch
will be on; if the gate voltage is a digital

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:30.270
1, the switch will be off - basically the
opposite behavior of the NFET switch.

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:36.660
You may be wondering why we can't use NFETs
in pullup circuits or PFETs in pulldown circuits.

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:41.620
You'll get to explore the answer to this question
in the first lab of Assignment 2.

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:47.670
Meanwhile, the short answer is that the signaling
node will experience degraded signaling levels

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:52.370
and we'll loose the noise margins we've worked
so hard to create!

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:57.040
Now consider the CMOS implementation of a
combinational inverter.

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:03.360
If the inverter's input is a digital 0, its
output is a digital 1, and vice versa.

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:08.370
The inverter circuit consists of a single
NFET switch for the pulldown circuit, connecting

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:13.890
the output node to GROUND and a single PFET
switch for the pullup circuit, connecting

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:16.280
the output to V_DD.

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:21.210
The gate terminals of both switches are connected
to the inverter's input node.

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:24.850
The inverter's voltage transfer characteristic
is shown in the figure.

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:31.890
When V_IN is a digital 0 input, we see that
V_OUT is greater than or equal to V_OH, representing

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:34.310
a digital 1 output.

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:38.770
Let's look at the state of the pullup and
pulldown switches when the input is a digital

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:39.770
0.

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:45.650
Recalling the simple mental model for the
NFET and PFET switches, a 0-input means the

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:50.720
NFET switch is off, so there's no connection
between the output node and ground, and the

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:56.510
PFET switch is on, making a connection between
the output node and V_DD.

00:03:56.510 --> 00:04:00.270
Current will flow through the pullup switch,
charging the output node until its voltage

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:02.470
reaches V_DD.

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:07.120
Once both the source and drain terminals are
at V_DD, there's no voltage difference across

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:11.440
the switch and hence no more current will
flow through the switch.

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:18.260
Similarly, when V_IN is a digital 1, the NFET
switch is on and PFET switch is off, so the

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:22.800
output is connected to ground and eventually
reaches a voltage of 0V.

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:29.400
Again, current flow through pulldown switch
will cease once the output node reaches 0V.

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:33.810
When the input voltage is in the middle of
its range, it's possible, depending on the

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:38.840
particular power supply voltage used and the
threshold voltage of the MOSFETs, that both

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:43.140
the pullup and pulldown circuits will be conducting
for a short period of time.

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:44.140
That's okay.

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:49.310
In fact, with both MOSFET switches on, small
changes in the input voltage will produce

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:56.710
large changes in the output voltage, leading
to the very high gain exhibited by CMOS devices.

00:04:56.710 --> 00:05:00.750
This in turn will mean we can pick signaling
thresholds that incorporate generous noise

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:07.560
margins, allowing CMOS devices to work reliably
in many different operating environments.

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:10.950
This is our first CMOS combinational logic
gate.

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:15.120
In the next video, we'll explore how to build
other, more interesting logic functions.
