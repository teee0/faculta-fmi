00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:05.320
Let's make some measurements using one of
the simplest combinational devices: a buffer.

00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:10.469
A buffer has a single input and a single output,
where the output will be driven with the same

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:15.659
digital value as the input after some small
propagation delay.

00:00:15.659 --> 00:00:20.580
This buffer obeys the static discipline - that's
what it means to be combinational - and uses

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:27.130
our revised signaling specification that includes
both low and high noise margins.

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:31.470
The measurements will be made by setting the
input voltage to a sequence of values ranging

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:35.450
from 0V up to the power supply voltage.

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:39.590
After setting the input voltage to a particular
value, we'll wait for the output voltage to

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:45.540
become stable, i.e., we'll wait for the propagation
delay of the buffer.

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:49.930
We'll plot the result on a graph with the
input voltage on the horizontal axis and the

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:53.580
measured output voltage on the vertical axis.

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:59.080
The resulting curve is called the voltage
transfer characteristic of the buffer.

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:05.019
For convenience, we've marked our signal thresholds
on the two axes.

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:09.050
Before we start plotting points, note that
the static discipline constrains what the

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:14.140
voltage transfer characteristic must look
like for any combinational device.

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:18.850
If we wait for the propagation delay of the
device, the measured output voltage must be

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:24.890
a valid digital value if the input voltage
is a valid digital value - "valid in, valid

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:27.470
out".

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:32.600
We can show this graphically as shaded forbidden
regions on our graph.

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:37.620
Points in these regions correspond to valid
digital input voltages but invalid digital

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:39.660
output voltages.

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:43.970
So if we're measuring a legal combinational
device, none of the points in its voltage

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:46.940
transfer characteristic will fall within these
regions.

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:53.440
Okay, back to our buffer: setting the input
voltage to a value less than the low input

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:58.020
threshold V_IL, produces an output voltage
less than V_OL, as expected.

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:05.170
A digital 0 input yields a digital 0 output.

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:10.649
Trying a slightly higher but still valid 0
input gives a similar result.

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:14.530
Note that these measurements don't tell us
anything about the speed of the buffer, they

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:20.519
are just measuring the static behavior of
the device, not its dynamic behavior.

00:02:20.519 --> 00:02:24.900
If we proceed to make all the additional measurements,
we get the voltage transfer characteristic

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:29.560
of the buffer, shown as the black curve on
the graph.

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:34.099
Notice that the curve does not pass through
the shaded regions, meeting the expectations

00:02:34.099 --> 00:02:39.418
we set out above for the behavior of a legal
combinational device.

00:02:39.418 --> 00:02:43.810
There are two interesting observations to
be made about voltage transfer characteristics.

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:48.730
Let's look more carefully at the white region
in the center of the graph, corresponding

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:53.200
to input voltages in the range V_IL to V_IH.

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:58.189
First note that these input voltages are in
the forbidden zone of our signaling specification

00:02:58.189 --> 00:03:03.069
and so a combinational device can produce
any output voltage it likes and still obey

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:09.349
the static discipline, which only constrains
the device's behavior for *valid* inputs.

00:03:09.349 --> 00:03:14.219
Second, note that the center white region
bounded by the four voltage thresholds is

00:03:14.219 --> 00:03:16.480
taller than it is wide.

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:22.719
This is true because our signaling specification
has positive noise margins, so V_OH - V_OL

00:03:22.719 --> 00:03:27.209
is strictly greater than V_IH - V_IL.

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:31.920
Any curve passing through this region - as
the VTC must - has to have some portion where

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:36.129
the magnitude of the slope of the curve is
greater than 1.

00:03:36.129 --> 00:03:40.230
At the point where the magnitude of the slope
of the VTC is greater than one, note that

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:46.249
a small change in the input voltage produces
a larger change in the output voltage.

00:03:46.249 --> 00:03:50.269
That's what it means when the magnitude of
the slope is greater than 1.

00:03:50.269 --> 00:03:55.560
In electrical terms, we would say the device
as a gain greater than 1 or less than -1,

00:03:55.560 --> 00:04:02.219
where we define gain as the change in output
voltage for a given change in input voltage.

00:04:02.219 --> 00:04:07.280
If we're considering building larger circuits
out of our combinational components, any output

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:10.709
can potentially be wired to some other input.

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:16.529
This means the range on the horizontal axis
(V_IN) has to be the same as the range on

00:04:16.529 --> 00:04:24.139
the vertical axis (V_OUT), i.e., the graph
of VTC must be square and the VTC curve fits

00:04:24.139 --> 00:04:27.000
inside the square.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:31.680
In order to fit within the square bounds,
the VTC must change slope at some point since

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:36.020
we know from above there must be regions where
the magnitude of the slope is greater than

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:41.240
1 and it can't be greater than 1 across the
whole input range.

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:46.300
Devices that exhibit a change in gain across
their operating range are called nonlinear

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:48.770
devices.

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:54.090
Together these observations tell us that we
cannot only use linear devices such as resistors,

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:57.560
capacitors and inductors, to build combinational
devices.

00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:02.090
We'll need nonlinear devices with gain greater
than 1.

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:05.180
Finding such devices is the subject of the
next chapter.
