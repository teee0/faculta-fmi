00:00:00.989 --> 00:00:05.919
There are three architectural parameters that
characterize a virtual memory system and hence

00:00:05.919 --> 00:00:08.920
the architecture of the MMU.

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:14.889
P is the number of address bits used for the
page offset in both virtual and physical addresses.

00:00:14.889 --> 00:00:19.680
V is the number of address bits used for the
virtual page number.

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:24.990
And M is the number of address bits used for
the physical page number.

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:29.740
All the other parameters, listed on the right,
are derived from these three parameters.

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:36.040
As mentioned earlier, the typical page size
is between 4KB and 16KB, the sweet spot in

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:41.720
the tradeoff between the downside of using
physical memory to hold unwanted locations

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:47.300
and the upside of reading as much as possible
from secondary storage so as to amortize the

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:53.520
high cost of accessing the initial word over
as many words as possible.

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:58.280
The size of the virtual address is determined
by the ISA.

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:02.910
We're now making the transition from 32-bit
architectures, which support a 4 gigabyte

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:10.020
virtual address space, to 64-bit architectures,
which support a 16 exabyte virtual address

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:11.020
space.

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:19.880
"Exa" is the SI prefix for 10^18 - a 64-bit
address can access a *lot* of memory!

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:24.469
The limitations of a small virtual address
have been the main cause for the extinction

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:25.950
of many ISAs.

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:31.650
Of course, each generation of engineers thinks
that the transition they make will be the

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:32.829
final one!

00:01:32.829 --> 00:01:38.119
I can remember when we all thought that 32
bits was an unimaginably large address.

00:01:38.119 --> 00:01:43.770
Back then we're buying memory by the megabyte
and only in our fantasies did we think one

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:48.399
could have a system with several thousand
megabytes.

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:53.729
Today's CPU architects are feeling pretty
smug about 64 bits - we'll see how they feel

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:56.219
in a couple of decades!

00:01:56.219 --> 00:02:01.200
The size of physical addresses is currently
between 30 bits (for embedded processors with

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:08.288
modest memory needs) and 40+ bits (for servers
that handle large data sets).

00:02:08.288 --> 00:02:12.500
Since CPU implementations are expected to
change every couple of years, the choice of

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:18.320
physical memory size can be adjusted to match
current technologies.

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:23.950
Since programmers use virtual addresses, they're
insulated from this implementation choice.

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:28.450
The MMU ensures that existing software will
continue to function correctly with different

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:30.750
sizes of physical memory.

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:36.940
The programmer may notice differences in performance,
but not in basic functionality.

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:42.610
For example, suppose our system supported
a 32-bit virtual address, a 30-bit physical

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:45.290
address and a 4KB page size.

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:55.370
So p = 12, v = 32-12 = 20, and m = 30 - 12
= 18.

00:02:55.370 --> 00:03:00.980
There are 2^m physical pages, which is 2^18
in our example.

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:06.580
There are 2^v virtual pages, which is 2^20
in our example.

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:12.820
And since there is one entry in the page map
for each virtual page, there are 2^20 (approximately

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:16.579
one million) page map entries.

00:03:16.579 --> 00:03:24.481
Each page map entry contains a PPN, an R bit
and a D bit, for a total of m+2 bits, which

00:03:24.481 --> 00:03:26.870
is 20 bits in our example.

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:31.660
So there are approximately 20 million bits
in the page map.

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:36.670
If we were thinking of using a large special-purpose
static RAM to hold the page map, this would

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:39.350
get pretty expensive!

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:42.760
But why use a special-purpose memory for the
page map?

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:47.010
Why not use a portion of main memory, which
we have a lot of and have already bought and

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:48.670
paid for?

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:52.910
We could use a register, called the page map
pointer, to hold the address of the page map

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:54.220
array in main memory.

00:03:54.220 --> 00:04:00.200
In other words, the page map would occupy
some number of dedicated physical pages.

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:05.060
Using the desired virtual page number as an
index, the hardware could perform the usual

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:11.570
array access calculation to fetch the needed
page map entry from main memory.

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:16.310
The downside of this proposed implementation
is that it now takes two accesses to physical

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:21.728
memory to perform one virtual access:
the first to retrieve the page table entry

00:04:21.728 --> 00:04:27.249
needed for the virtual-to-physical address
translation, and the second to actually access

00:04:27.249 --> 00:04:28.810
the requested location.

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:32.139
Once again, caches to the rescue.

00:04:32.139 --> 00:04:36.710
Most systems incorporate a special-purpose
cache, called a translation look-aside buffer

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:41.759
(TLB), that maps virtual page numbers to physical
page numbers.

00:04:41.759 --> 00:04:46.100
The TLB is usually small and quite fast.

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:52.939
It's usually fully-associative to ensure the
best possible hit ratio by avoiding collisions.

00:04:52.939 --> 00:04:58.129
If the PPN is found by using the TLB, the
access to main memory for the page table entry

00:04:58.129 --> 00:05:05.050
can be avoided, and we're back to a single
physical access for each virtual access.

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:10.129
The hit ratio of a TLB is quite high, usually
better than 99%.

00:05:10.129 --> 00:05:14.720
This isn't too surprising since locality and
the notion of a working set suggest that only

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:20.470
a small number of pages are in active use
over short periods of time.

00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:27.150
As we'll see in a few slides, there are interesting
variations to this simple TLB page-map-in-main-memory

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:28.610
architecture.

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:32.840
But the basic strategy will remain the same.

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:37.169
Putting it all together:
the virtual address generated by the CPU is

00:05:37.169 --> 00:05:44.199
first processed by the TLB to see if the appropriate
translation from VPN to PPN has been cached.

00:05:44.199 --> 00:05:48.779
If so, the main memory access can proceed
directly.

00:05:48.779 --> 00:05:54.210
If the desired mapping is not in the TLB,
the appropriate entry in the page map is accessed

00:05:54.210 --> 00:05:56.139
in main memory.

00:05:56.139 --> 00:06:01.039
If the page is resident, the PPN field of
the page map entry is used to complete the

00:06:01.039 --> 00:06:02.289
address translation.

00:06:02.289 --> 00:06:08.379
And, of course, the translation is cached
in the TLB so that subsequent accesses to

00:06:08.379 --> 00:06:12.819
this page can avoid the access to the page
map.

00:06:12.819 --> 00:06:18.270
If the desired page is not resident, the MMU
triggers a page fault exception and the page

00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:21.039
fault handler code will deal with the problem.

00:06:21.039 --> 00:06:24.949
Here's a final example showing all the pieces
in action.

00:06:24.949 --> 00:06:32.120
In this example, p = 10, v = 22, and m = 14.

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:36.279
How many pages can reside in physical memory
at one time?

00:06:36.279 --> 00:06:41.770
There are 2^m physical pages, so 2^14.

00:06:41.770 --> 00:06:45.199
How many entries are there in the page table?

00:06:45.199 --> 00:06:50.330
There's one entry for each virtual page and
there are 2^v virtual pages, so there are

00:06:50.330 --> 00:06:54.419
2^22 entries in the page table.

00:06:54.419 --> 00:06:57.050
How many bits per entry in the page table?

00:06:57.050 --> 00:07:01.389
Assume each entry holds the PPN, the resident
bit, and the dirty bit.

00:07:01.389 --> 00:07:08.210
Since the PPN is m bits, there are m+2 bits
in each entry, so 16 bits.

00:07:08.210 --> 00:07:12.159
How many pages does the page table occupy?

00:07:12.159 --> 00:07:20.589
There are 2^v page table entries, each occupying
(m+2)/8 bytes, so the total size of the page

00:07:20.589 --> 00:07:24.539
table in this example is 2^23 bytes.

00:07:24.539 --> 00:07:37.259
Each page holds 2^p = 2^10 bytes, so the page
table occupies 2^23/2^10 = 2^13 pages.

00:07:37.259 --> 00:07:42.469
What fraction of virtual memory can be resident
at any given time?

00:07:42.469 --> 00:07:47.069
There are 2^v virtual pages, of which 2^m
can be resident.

00:07:47.069 --> 00:07:59.069
So the fraction of resident pages
is 2^m/2^v = 2^14/2^22 = 1/2^8.

00:07:59.069 --> 00:08:04.259
What is the physical address for virtual address
0x1804?

00:08:04.259 --> 00:08:09.169
Which MMU components are involved in the translation?

00:08:09.169 --> 00:08:13.439
First we have to decompose the virtual address
into VPN and offset.

00:08:13.439 --> 00:08:18.159
The offset is the low-order 10 bits, so is
0x004 in this example.

00:08:18.159 --> 00:08:23.159
The VPN is the remaining address bits, so
the VPN is 0x6.

00:08:23.159 --> 00:08:29.340
Looking first in the TLB, we that the VPN-to-PPN
mapping for VPN 0x6 is cached,

00:08:29.340 --> 00:08:35.409
so we can construct the physical address by
concatenating the PPN (0x2) with the 10-bit

00:08:35.409 --> 00:08:38.929
offset (0x4) to get a physical address of
0x804.

00:08:38.929 --> 00:08:39.940
You're right!

00:08:39.940 --> 00:08:47.110
It's a bit of pain to do all the bit manipulations
when p is not a multiple of 4.

00:08:47.110 --> 00:08:51.490
How about virtual address 0x1080?

00:08:51.490 --> 00:08:56.139
For this address the VPN is 0x4 and the offset
is 0x80.

00:08:56.139 --> 00:09:01.589
The translation for VPN 0x4 is not cached
in the TLB, so we have to check the page map,

00:09:01.589 --> 00:09:05.600
which tells us that the page is resident in
physical page 5.

00:09:05.600 --> 00:09:12.350
Concatenating the PPN and offset, we get 0x1480
as the physical address.

00:09:12.350 --> 00:09:17.620
Finally, how about virtual address 0x0FC?

00:09:17.620 --> 00:09:22.529
Here the VPN is 0 and the offset 0xFC.

00:09:22.529 --> 00:09:27.690
The mapping for VPN 0 is not found in the
TLB and checking the page map reveals that

00:09:27.690 --> 00:09:35.079
VPN 0 is not resident in main memory, so a
page fault exception is triggered.

00:09:35.079 --> 00:09:40.889
There are a few things to note about the example
TLB and page map contents.

00:09:40.889 --> 00:09:45.240
Note that a TLB entry can be invalid (it's
R bit is 0).

00:09:45.240 --> 00:09:50.560
This can happen when a virtual page is replaced,
so when we change the R bit to 0 in the page

00:09:50.560 --> 00:09:54.170
map, we have to do the same in the TLB.

00:09:54.170 --> 00:09:59.649
And should we be concerned that PPN 0x5 appears
twice in the page table?

00:09:59.649 --> 00:10:05.610
Note that the entry for VPN 0x3 doesn't matter
since it's R bit is 0.

00:10:05.610 --> 00:10:09.399
Typically when marking a page not resident,
we don't bother to clear out the other fields

00:10:09.399 --> 00:10:12.930
in the entry since they won't be used when
R=0.

00:10:12.930 --> 00:10:15.800
So there's only one *valid* mapping to PPN
5.
