1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:05,520
So, how hard can it be to build a communication
channel?

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:11,070
Aren't they just logic circuits with a long
wire that runs from one component to another?

3
00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:16,800
A circuit theorist would tell you that wires
in a schematic diagram are intended to represent

4
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:22,779
the equipotential nodes of the circuit, which
are used to connect component terminals.

5
00:00:22,779 --> 00:00:27,550
In this simple model, a wire has the same
voltage at all points and any changes in the

6
00:00:27,550 --> 00:00:32,840
voltage or current at one component terminal
is instantly propagated to the other component

7
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:36,030
terminals connected to the same wire.

8
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:41,850
The notion of distance is abstracted out of
our circuit models: terminals are either connected

9
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:44,260
by a wire, or they're not.

10
00:00:44,260 --> 00:00:49,020
If there are resistances, capacitances, and
inductances that need to be accounted for,

11
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:53,140
the necessary components can be added to the
circuit model.

12
00:00:53,140 --> 00:00:54,250
Wires are timeless.

13
00:00:54,250 --> 00:01:00,690
They are used to show how components connect,
but they aren't themselves components.

14
00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:06,000
In fact, thinking of wires as equipotential
nodes is a very workable model when the rate

15
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,570
of change of the voltage on the wire is slow
compared to the time it takes for an electromagnetic

16
00:01:11,570 --> 00:01:14,910
wave to propagate down the wire.

17
00:01:14,910 --> 00:01:19,430
Only as circuit speeds have increased with
advances in integrated circuit technologies

18
00:01:19,430 --> 00:01:24,240
did this rule-of-thumb start to be violated
in logic circuits where the components were

19
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:29,240
separated by at most 10's of inches.

20
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:34,039
In fact, it has been known since the late
1800s that changes in voltage levels take

21
00:01:34,039 --> 00:01:37,509
finite time to propagate down a wire.

22
00:01:37,509 --> 00:01:42,140
Oliver Heaviside was a self-taught English
electrical engineer who, in the 1880's, developed

23
00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:48,720
a set of "telegrapher's equations" that described
how signals propagate down wires.

24
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:54,180
Using these, he was able to show how to improve
the rate of transmission on then new transatlantic

25
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:57,700
telegraph cable by a factor of 10.

26
00:01:57,700 --> 00:02:03,030
We now know that for high-speed signaling
we have to treat wires as transmission lines,

27
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:06,100
which we'll say more about in the next few
slides.

28
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:11,650
In this domain, the distance between components
and hence the lengths of wires is of critical

29
00:02:11,650 --> 00:02:16,440
concern if we want to correctly predict the
performance of our circuits.

30
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:24,650
Distance and signal propagation matter - real-world
wires are, in fact, fairly complex components!

31
00:02:24,650 --> 00:02:29,930
Here's an electrical model for an infinitesimally
small segment of a real-world wire.

32
00:02:29,930 --> 00:02:35,510
An actual wire is correctly modeled by imagining
a many copies of the model shown here connected

33
00:02:35,510 --> 00:02:37,590
end-to-end.

34
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:41,930
The signal, i.e., the voltage on the wire,
is measured with respect to the reference

35
00:02:41,930 --> 00:02:45,220
node which is also shown in the model.

36
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:49,060
There are 4 parameters that characterize the
behavior of the wire.

37
00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:52,190
R tells us the resistance of the conductor.

38
00:02:52,190 --> 00:02:56,660
It's usually negligible for the wiring on
printed circuit boards, but it can be significant

39
00:02:56,660 --> 00:03:00,000
for long wires in integrated circuits.

40
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:05,629
L represents the self-inductance of the conductor,
which characterizes how much energy will be

41
00:03:05,629 --> 00:03:12,950
absorbed by the wire's magnetic fields when
the current flowing through the wire changes.

42
00:03:12,950 --> 00:03:18,440
The conductor and reference node are separated
by some sort insulator (which might be just

43
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:21,890
air!) and hence form a capacitor with capacitance
C.

44
00:03:21,890 --> 00:03:28,170
Finally, the conductance G represents the
current that leaks through the insulator.

45
00:03:28,170 --> 00:03:29,900
Usually this is quite small.

46
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:34,840
The table shows the parameter values we might
measure for wires inside an integrated circuit

47
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:38,280
and on printed circuit boards.

48
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:43,980
If we analyze what happens when sending signals
down the wire, we can describe the behavior

49
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:49,569
of the wires using a single component called
a transmission line, which has a characteristic

50
00:03:49,569 --> 00:03:53,049
complex-valued impedance Z_0.

51
00:03:53,049 --> 00:03:58,190
At high signaling frequencies and over the
distances found on-chip or on circuit boards,

52
00:03:58,190 --> 00:04:03,700
such as one might find in a modern digital
system, the transmission line is lossless,

53
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:10,040
and voltage changes ("steps") propagate down
the wire at the rate of 1/sqrt(LC) meters

54
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:12,159
per second.

55
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:16,579
Using the values given here for a printed
circuit board, the characteristic impedance

56
00:04:16,579 --> 00:04:26,160
is approximately 50 ohms and the speed of
propagation is about 18 cm (7") per ns.

57
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:31,300
To send digital information from one component
to another, we change the voltage on the connecting

58
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:36,120
wire, and that voltage step propagates from
the sender to the receiver.

59
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:40,090
We have to pay some attention to what happens
to that energy front when it gets to the end

60
00:04:40,090 --> 00:04:41,460
of the wire!

61
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:46,889
If we do nothing to absorb that energy, conservation
laws tell us that it reflects off the end

62
00:04:46,889 --> 00:04:52,139
of the wire as an "echo" and soon our wire
will be full of echoes from previous voltage

63
00:04:52,139 --> 00:04:54,280
steps!

64
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:58,720
To prevent these echoes we have to terminate
the wire with a resistance to ground that

65
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:02,840
matches the characteristic impedance of the
transmission line.

66
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:08,580
If the signal can propagate in both directions,
we'll need to terminate at both ends.

67
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:13,150
What this model is telling is the time it
takes to transmit information from one component

68
00:05:13,150 --> 00:05:18,889
to another and that we have to be careful
to absorb the energy associated with the transmission

69
00:05:18,889 --> 00:05:22,730
when the information has reached its destination.

70
00:05:22,730 --> 00:05:27,110
With that little bit of theory as background,
we're in a position to describe the real-world

71
00:05:27,110 --> 00:05:31,110
consequences of poor engineering of our signal
wires.

72
00:05:31,110 --> 00:05:36,470
The key observation is that unless we're careful
there can still be energy left over from previous

73
00:05:36,470 --> 00:05:41,020
transmissions that might corrupt the current
transmission.

74
00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:46,190
The general fix to this problem is time, i.e.,
giving the transmitted value a longer time

75
00:05:46,190 --> 00:05:49,409
to settle to an interference-free value.

76
00:05:49,409 --> 00:05:54,170
But slowing down isn't usually acceptable
in high-performance systems, so we have to

77
00:05:54,170 --> 00:05:58,759
do our best to minimize these energy-storage
effects.

78
00:05:58,759 --> 00:06:03,560
If the termination isn't exactly right, we'll
get some reflections from any voltage step

79
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:08,630
reaching the end of the wire, and it will
take a while for these echoes to die out.

80
00:06:08,630 --> 00:06:14,039
In fact, as we'll see, energy will reflect
off of any impedance discontinuity, which

81
00:06:14,039 --> 00:06:17,759
means we'll want to minimize the number of
such discontinuities.

82
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:24,440
We need to be careful to allow sufficient
time for signals to reach valid logic levels.

83
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:31,020
The shaded region shows a transition of the
wire A from 1 to 0 to 1.

84
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:35,590
The first inverter is trying to produce a
1-output from the initial input transition

85
00:06:35,590 --> 00:06:41,180
to 0, but doesn't have sufficient time to
complete the transition on wire B before the

86
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:43,800
input changes again.

87
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:49,139
This leads to a runt pulse on wire C, the
output of the second inverter, and we see

88
00:06:49,139 --> 00:06:55,400
that the sequence of bits on A has been corrupted
by the time the signal reaches C.

89
00:06:55,400 --> 00:07:00,210
This problem was caused by the energy storage
in the capacitance of the wire between the

90
00:07:00,210 --> 00:07:04,500
inverters, which will limit the speed at which
we can run the logic.

91
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:11,390
And here see we what happens when a large
voltage step triggers oscillations in a wire,

92
00:07:11,390 --> 00:07:16,220
called ringing, due to the wire's inductance
and capacitance.

93
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:20,710
The graph shows it takes some time before
the ringing dampens to the point that we have

94
00:07:20,710 --> 00:07:23,830
a reliable digital signal.

95
00:07:23,830 --> 00:07:28,759
The ringing can be diminished by spreading
the voltage step over a longer time.

96
00:07:28,759 --> 00:07:34,110
The key idea here is that by paying close
attention to the design of our wiring and

97
00:07:34,110 --> 00:07:39,240
the drivers that put information onto the
wire, we can minimize the performance implications

98
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:42,100
of these energy-storage effects.

99
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:45,280
Okay, enough electrical engineering!

100
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:48,319
Suppose we have some information in our system.

101
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:53,050
If we preserve that information over time,
we call that storage.

102
00:07:53,050 --> 00:07:58,129
If we send that information to another component,
we call that communication.

103
00:07:58,129 --> 00:08:03,599
In the real world, we've seen that communication
takes time and we have to budget for that

104
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:05,819
time in our system timing.

105
00:08:05,819 --> 00:08:11,800
Our engineering has to accommodate the fundamental
bounds on propagating speeds, distances between

106
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:16,919
components, and how fast we can change wire
voltages without triggering the effects we

107
00:08:16,919 --> 00:08:18,970
saw on the previous slide.

108
00:08:18,970 --> 00:08:24,940
The upshot: our timing models will have to
account for wire delays.

109
00:08:24,940 --> 00:08:29,169
In Part 1 of this course, we had a simple
timing model that assigned a fixed propagation

110
00:08:29,169 --> 00:08:34,929
delay, t_PD, to the time it took for the output
of a logic gate to reflect a change to the

111
00:08:34,929 --> 00:08:36,260
gate's input.

112
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:41,419
We'll need to change our timing model to account
for delay of transmitting the output of a

113
00:08:41,419 --> 00:08:44,600
logic gate to the next components.

114
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:50,300
The timing will be load dependent, so signals
that connect to the inputs of many other gates

115
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:54,050
will be slower than signals that connect to
only one other gate.

116
00:08:54,050 --> 00:09:00,149
The Jade simulator takes the loading of a
gate's output signal into account when calculating

117
00:09:00,149 --> 00:09:03,890
the effective propagation delay of the gate.

118
00:09:03,890 --> 00:09:09,200
We can improve propagation delays by reducing
the number of loads on output signals or by

119
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:15,550
using specially-design gates called buffers
(the component shown in red) to drive signals

120
00:09:15,550 --> 00:09:17,580
that have very large loads.

121
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:23,790
A common task when optimizing the performance
of a circuit is to track down heavily-loaded

122
00:09:23,790 --> 00:09:30,480
and hence slow wires and re-engineering the
circuit to make them faster.

123
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:35,440
Today our concern is wires used to connect
components at the system level.

124
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:40,490
So next we'll turn our attention to possible
designs for system-level interconnect and

125
00:09:40,490 --> 00:09:42,050
the issues that might arise.
