1
00:00:01,069 --> 00:00:05,819
Now that we have some sense about how MOSFETs
function, let's use them to build circuits

2
00:00:05,819 --> 00:00:09,270
to process our digitally encoded information.

3
00:00:09,270 --> 00:00:14,249
We have two simple rules we'll use when building
the circuits, which, if they're followed,

4
00:00:14,249 --> 00:00:19,310
will allow us to abstract the behavior of
the MOSFET as a simple voltage-controlled

5
00:00:19,310 --> 00:00:20,900
switch.

6
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:27,020
The first rule is that we'll only use n-channel
MOSFETs, which we'll call NFETs for short,

7
00:00:27,020 --> 00:00:31,259
when building pulldown circuits that connect
a signaling node to the GROUND rail of the

8
00:00:31,259 --> 00:00:33,140
power supply.

9
00:00:33,140 --> 00:00:38,540
When the pulldown circuit is conducting, the
signaling node will be at 0V and qualify as

10
00:00:38,540 --> 00:00:41,600
the digital value "0".

11
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:47,059
If we obey this rule, NFETs will act switches
controlled by V_GS, the difference between

12
00:00:47,059 --> 00:00:50,620
the voltage of the gate terminal and the voltage
of the source terminal.

13
00:00:50,620 --> 00:00:56,670
When V_GS is lower than the MOSFET's threshold
voltage, the switch is "open" or not conducting

14
00:00:56,670 --> 00:01:01,850
and there is no connection between the MOSFET's
source and drain terminals.

15
00:01:01,850 --> 00:01:07,010
If V_GS is greater than the threshold voltage,
the switch is "on" or conducting and there

16
00:01:07,010 --> 00:01:10,280
is a connection between the source and drain
terminals.

17
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:14,510
That path has a resistance determined by the
magnitude of V_GS.

18
00:01:14,510 --> 00:01:18,950
The larger V_GS, the lower the effective resistance
of the switch and the more current that will

19
00:01:18,950 --> 00:01:21,658
flow from drain to source.

20
00:01:21,658 --> 00:01:26,729
When designing pulldown circuits of NFET switches,
we can use the following simple mental model

21
00:01:26,729 --> 00:01:31,590
for each NFET switch:
if the gate voltage is a digital 0, the switch

22
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:37,658
will be off; if the gate voltage is a digital
1, the switch will be on.

23
00:01:37,658 --> 00:01:43,619
The situation with PFET switches is analogous,
except that the potentials are reversed.

24
00:01:43,619 --> 00:01:49,420
Our rule is that PFETs can only be used in
pullup circuits, used to connect a signaling

25
00:01:49,420 --> 00:01:53,689
node to the power supply voltage, which we'll
call V_DD.

26
00:01:53,689 --> 00:01:58,189
When the pullup circuit is conducting, the
signaling node will be at V_DD volts and qualify

27
00:01:58,189 --> 00:02:02,409
as the digital value "1".

28
00:02:02,409 --> 00:02:07,100
PFETs have a negative threshold voltage and
V_GS has to be less than the threshold voltage

29
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:10,000
in order for the PFET switch to be conducting.

30
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,550
All these negatives can be a bit confusing,
but, happily there's a simple mental model

31
00:02:14,550 --> 00:02:18,110
we can use for each PFET switch in the pullup
circuit:

32
00:02:18,110 --> 00:02:23,480
if the gate voltage is a digital 0, the switch
will be on; if the gate voltage is a digital

33
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:30,270
1, the switch will be off - basically the
opposite behavior of the NFET switch.

34
00:02:30,270 --> 00:02:36,660
You may be wondering why we can't use NFETs
in pullup circuits or PFETs in pulldown circuits.

35
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:41,620
You'll get to explore the answer to this question
in the first lab of Assignment 2.

36
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:47,670
Meanwhile, the short answer is that the signaling
node will experience degraded signaling levels

37
00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:52,370
and we'll loose the noise margins we've worked
so hard to create!

38
00:02:52,370 --> 00:02:57,040
Now consider the CMOS implementation of a
combinational inverter.

39
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:03,360
If the inverter's input is a digital 0, its
output is a digital 1, and vice versa.

40
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:08,370
The inverter circuit consists of a single
NFET switch for the pulldown circuit, connecting

41
00:03:08,370 --> 00:03:13,890
the output node to GROUND and a single PFET
switch for the pullup circuit, connecting

42
00:03:13,890 --> 00:03:16,280
the output to V_DD.

43
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:21,210
The gate terminals of both switches are connected
to the inverter's input node.

44
00:03:21,210 --> 00:03:24,850
The inverter's voltage transfer characteristic
is shown in the figure.

45
00:03:24,850 --> 00:03:31,890
When V_IN is a digital 0 input, we see that
V_OUT is greater than or equal to V_OH, representing

46
00:03:31,890 --> 00:03:34,310
a digital 1 output.

47
00:03:34,310 --> 00:03:38,770
Let's look at the state of the pullup and
pulldown switches when the input is a digital

48
00:03:38,770 --> 00:03:39,770
0.

49
00:03:39,770 --> 00:03:45,650
Recalling the simple mental model for the
NFET and PFET switches, a 0-input means the

50
00:03:45,650 --> 00:03:50,720
NFET switch is off, so there's no connection
between the output node and ground, and the

51
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:56,510
PFET switch is on, making a connection between
the output node and V_DD.

52
00:03:56,510 --> 00:04:00,270
Current will flow through the pullup switch,
charging the output node until its voltage

53
00:04:00,270 --> 00:04:02,470
reaches V_DD.

54
00:04:02,470 --> 00:04:07,120
Once both the source and drain terminals are
at V_DD, there's no voltage difference across

55
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:11,440
the switch and hence no more current will
flow through the switch.

56
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:18,260
Similarly, when V_IN is a digital 1, the NFET
switch is on and PFET switch is off, so the

57
00:04:18,260 --> 00:04:22,800
output is connected to ground and eventually
reaches a voltage of 0V.

58
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:29,400
Again, current flow through pulldown switch
will cease once the output node reaches 0V.

59
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:33,810
When the input voltage is in the middle of
its range, it's possible, depending on the

60
00:04:33,810 --> 00:04:38,840
particular power supply voltage used and the
threshold voltage of the MOSFETs, that both

61
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:43,140
the pullup and pulldown circuits will be conducting
for a short period of time.

62
00:04:43,140 --> 00:04:44,140
That's okay.

63
00:04:44,140 --> 00:04:49,310
In fact, with both MOSFET switches on, small
changes in the input voltage will produce

64
00:04:49,310 --> 00:04:56,710
large changes in the output voltage, leading
to the very high gain exhibited by CMOS devices.

65
00:04:56,710 --> 00:05:00,750
This in turn will mean we can pick signaling
thresholds that incorporate generous noise

66
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:07,560
margins, allowing CMOS devices to work reliably
in many different operating environments.

67
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:10,950
This is our first CMOS combinational logic
gate.

68
00:05:10,950 --> 00:05:15,120
In the next video, we'll explore how to build
other, more interesting logic functions.
