1
00:00:01,449 --> 00:00:06,799
There's one more issue we need to deal with
before finalizing our signaling specification.

2
00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:11,250
Consider the following combinational system
where the upstream combinational device on

3
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:17,770
the left is trying to send a digital 0 to
the downstream combinational device on right.

4
00:00:17,770 --> 00:00:23,540
The upstream device is generating an output
voltage just slightly below V_L, which, according

5
00:00:23,540 --> 00:00:30,420
to our proposed signaling specification, qualifies
as the representation for a digital 0.

6
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:35,150
Now suppose some electrical noise slightly
changes the voltage on the wire so that the

7
00:00:35,150 --> 00:00:39,960
voltage detected on the input of the downstream
device is slightly above V_L,

8
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:46,940
i.e., the received signal no longer qualifies
as a valid digital input and the combinational

9
00:00:46,940 --> 00:00:51,150
behavior of the downstream device is no longer
guaranteed.

10
00:00:51,150 --> 00:00:58,230
Oops, our system is behaving incorrectly because
of some small amount of electrical noise.

11
00:00:58,230 --> 00:01:05,330
Just the sort of flaky behavior we are hoping
to avoid by adopting a digital systems architecture.

12
00:01:05,330 --> 00:01:10,310
One way to address the problem is to adjust
the signaling specification so that outputs

13
00:01:10,310 --> 00:01:16,189
have to obey tighter bounds than the inputs,
the idea being to ensure that valid output

14
00:01:16,189 --> 00:01:22,289
signals can be affected by noise without becoming
invalid input signals.

15
00:01:22,289 --> 00:01:25,959
Can we avoid the problem altogether by somehow
avoiding noise?

16
00:01:25,959 --> 00:01:30,939
A nice thought, but not a goal that we can
achieve if we're planning to use electrical

17
00:01:30,939 --> 00:01:32,259
components.

18
00:01:32,259 --> 00:01:37,229
Voltage noise, which we'll define as variations
away from nominal voltage values, comes from

19
00:01:37,229 --> 00:01:40,359
a variety of sources.

20
00:01:40,359 --> 00:01:45,020
Noise can be caused by electrical effects
such as IR drops in conductors due to Ohm's

21
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:51,590
law, capacitive coupling between conductors,
and L(dI/dt) effects caused by inductance

22
00:01:51,590 --> 00:01:56,200
in the component's leads and changing currents.

23
00:01:56,200 --> 00:02:00,399
Voltage deviations can be caused manufacturing
variations in component parameters from their

24
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:04,850
nominal values that lead to small differences
in electrical behavior device-to-device.

25
00:02:04,850 --> 00:02:12,150
Voltages can be effected by environmental
factors such as thermal noise or voltage effects

26
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:14,210
from external electromagnetic fields.

27
00:02:14,210 --> 00:02:17,890
The list goes on!

28
00:02:17,890 --> 00:02:22,640
Note that in many cases, noise is caused by
normal operation of the circuit or is an inherent

29
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:28,280
property of the materials and processes used
to make the circuits, and so is unavoidable.

30
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:33,930
However, we can predict the magnitude of the
noise and adjust our signaling specification

31
00:02:33,930 --> 00:02:34,930
appropriately.

32
00:02:34,930 --> 00:02:37,349
Let's see how this would work.

33
00:02:37,349 --> 00:02:41,610
Our proposed fix to the noise problem is to
provide separate signaling specifications

34
00:02:41,610 --> 00:02:44,860
for digital inputs and digital outputs.

35
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:50,329
To send a 0, digital outputs must produce
a voltage less than or equal to V_OL and to

36
00:02:50,329 --> 00:02:54,780
send a 1, produce a voltage greater than or
equal to V_OH.

37
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:59,730
So far this doesn't seem very different than
our previous signaling specification.

38
00:02:59,730 --> 00:03:04,629
The difference is that digital inputs must
obey a different signaling specification.

39
00:03:04,629 --> 00:03:10,349
Input voltages less than or equal to V_IL
must be interpreted as a digital 0 and input

40
00:03:10,349 --> 00:03:16,060
voltages greater than or equal to V_IH must
be interpreted as a digital 1.

41
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:21,840
The values of these four signaling thresholds
are chosen to satisfy the constraints shown

42
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,440
here.

43
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:30,769
Note that V_IL is strictly greater than V_OL
and V_IH is strictly less than V_OH.

44
00:03:30,769 --> 00:03:36,239
The gaps between the input and output voltage
thresholds are called the "noise margins."

45
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:41,310
The noise margins tell us how much noise can
be added to a valid 0 or a valid 1 output

46
00:03:41,310 --> 00:03:48,040
signal and still have the result interpreted
correctly at the inputs to which it is connected.

47
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:53,290
The smaller of the two noise margins is called
the "noise immunity" of the signaling specification.

48
00:03:53,290 --> 00:03:58,180
Our goal as digital engineers is to design
our signaling specifications to provide as

49
00:03:58,180 --> 00:04:02,689
much noise immunity as possible.

50
00:04:02,689 --> 00:04:06,540
Combinational devices that obey this signaling
specification work to remove the noise on

51
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:11,760
their inputs before it has a chance to accumulate
and eventually cause signaling errors.

52
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:17,089
The bottom line: digital signaling doesn't
suffer from the problems we saw in our earlier

53
00:04:17,089 --> 00:04:18,570
analog signaling example!
