1
00:00:00,399 --> 00:00:03,580
Now let's look at the electrical view of the
MOSFET.

2
00:00:03,580 --> 00:00:08,220
Its operation is determined by the voltages
of its four terminals.

3
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:12,249
First we'll label the two diffusion terminals
on either side of the gate terminal.

4
00:00:12,249 --> 00:00:17,000
Our convention is to call the diffusion terminal
with the highest voltage potential the "drain"

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,380
and the other lower-potential terminal the
"source".

6
00:00:21,380 --> 00:00:26,130
With this labeling if any current is flowing
through the MOSFET switch, it will flow from

7
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:28,830
drain to source.

8
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:34,400
When the MOSFET is manufactured, it's designed
to have a particular threshold voltage, V_TH,

9
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:42,510
which tells us when the switch goes from non-conducting
or "open" to conducting or "closed".

10
00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:50,370
For the n-channel MOSFET shown here, we'd
expect V_TH to be around

11
00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:55,740
The P+ terminal on the left of the diagram
is the connection to the p-type substrate.

12
00:00:55,740 --> 00:01:01,120
For the MOSFET to operate correctly, the substrate
must always have a voltage less than or equal

13
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:03,760
to the voltage of the source and drain.

14
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:07,650
We'll have specific rules about how to connect
up this terminal.

15
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:12,510
The MOSFET is controlled by the difference
between the voltage of the gate, V_G, and

16
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:18,510
the voltage of the source, V_S, which, following
the usual terminology for voltages, we call

17
00:01:18,510 --> 00:01:22,870
V_GS, a shortcut for saying V_G minus V_S.

18
00:01:22,870 --> 00:01:28,120
The first picture shows the configuration
of the MOSFET when V_GS is less than the MOSFET's

19
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:29,789
threshold voltage.

20
00:01:29,789 --> 00:01:35,360
In this configuration, the switch is open
or non-conducting, i.e., there is no electrical

21
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:37,830
connection between the source and drain.

22
00:01:37,830 --> 00:01:43,520
When n-type and p-type materials come in physical
contact, a depletion region (shown in dark

23
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:46,830
red in the diagram) forms at their junction.

24
00:01:46,830 --> 00:01:52,080
This is a region of substrate where the current-carrying
electrical particles have migrated away from

25
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:53,908
the junction.

26
00:01:53,908 --> 00:01:59,450
The depletion zone serves as an insulating
layer between the substrate and source/drain.

27
00:01:59,450 --> 00:02:04,490
The width of this insulating layer grows as
the voltage of source/drain gets larger relative

28
00:02:04,490 --> 00:02:06,280
to the voltage of the substrate.

29
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:11,989
And, as you can see in the diagram, that insulating
layer fills the region of the substrate between

30
00:02:11,989 --> 00:02:14,880
the source and drain terminals, keeping them
electrically isolated.

31
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:22,280
Now, as V_GS gets larger, positive charges
accumulate on the gate conductor and generate

32
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:27,829
an electrical field which attracts the electrons
in the atoms in the substrate.

33
00:02:27,829 --> 00:02:32,680
For a while that attractive force gets larger
without much happening, but when it reaches

34
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:37,370
the MOSFET's threshold voltage, the field
is strong enough to pull the substrate electrons

35
00:02:37,370 --> 00:02:40,459
from the valence band into the conduction
band,

36
00:02:40,459 --> 00:02:45,239
and the newly mobile electrons will move towards
the gate conductor, collecting just under

37
00:02:45,239 --> 00:02:50,180
the thin oxide that serves the gate capacitor's
insulator.

38
00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:55,260
When enough electrons accumulate, the type
of the semiconductor changes from p-type to

39
00:02:55,260 --> 00:03:00,819
n-type and there's now a channel of n-type
material forming a conducting path between

40
00:03:00,819 --> 00:03:03,689
the source and drain terminals.

41
00:03:03,689 --> 00:03:08,439
This layer of n-type material is called an
inversion layer, since its type has been inverted

42
00:03:08,439 --> 00:03:11,470
from the original p-type material.

43
00:03:11,470 --> 00:03:15,459
The MOSFET switch is now closed or conducting.

44
00:03:15,459 --> 00:03:20,010
Current will flow from drain to source in
proportion to V_DS, the difference in voltage

45
00:03:20,010 --> 00:03:23,720
between the drain and source terminals.

46
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:28,170
At this point the conducting inversion layer
is acting like a resistor governed by Ohm's

47
00:03:28,170 --> 00:03:37,079
Law so I_DS = V_DS/R where R is the effective
resistance of the channel.

48
00:03:37,079 --> 00:03:41,918
This process is reversible: if V_GS falls
below the threshold voltage, the substrate

49
00:03:41,918 --> 00:03:47,668
electrons drop back into the valence band,
the inversion layer disappears, and the switch

50
00:03:47,668 --> 00:03:50,329
no longer conducts.

51
00:03:50,329 --> 00:03:55,019
The story gets a bit more complicated when
V_DS is larger than V_GS, as shown in the

52
00:03:55,019 --> 00:03:56,339
bottom figures.

53
00:03:56,339 --> 00:04:02,359
A large V_DS changes the geometry of the electrical
fields in the channel and the inversion layer

54
00:04:02,359 --> 00:04:06,689
pinches off at the end of the channel near
the drain.

55
00:04:06,689 --> 00:04:11,269
But with a large V_DS, the electrons will
tunnel across the pinch-off point to reach

56
00:04:11,269 --> 00:04:16,019
the conducting inversion layer still present
next to the source terminal.

57
00:04:16,019 --> 00:04:20,478
How does pinch-off affect I_DS, the current
flowing from drain to source?

58
00:04:20,478 --> 00:04:24,909
To see, let's look at some plots of I_DS on
the next slide.

59
00:04:24,909 --> 00:04:30,669
Okay, this plot has a lot of information,
so let's see what we can learn.

60
00:04:30,669 --> 00:04:36,789
Each curve is a plot of I_DS as a function
of V_DS, for a particular value of V_GS.

61
00:04:36,789 --> 00:04:42,889
First, notice that I_DS is 0 when V_GS is
less than or equal to the threshold voltage.

62
00:04:42,889 --> 00:04:48,800
The first six curves are all plotted on top
of each other along the x-axis.

63
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:56,680
Once V_GS exceeds the threshold voltage I_DS
becomes non-zero, and increases as V_GS increases.

64
00:04:56,680 --> 00:05:02,270
This makes sense: the larger V_GS becomes,
the more substrate electrons are attracted

65
00:05:02,270 --> 00:05:07,229
to the bottom plate of the gate capacitor
and the thicker the inversion layer becomes,

66
00:05:07,229 --> 00:05:10,780
allowing it to conduct more current.

67
00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:16,360
When V_DS is smaller than V_GS, we said the
MOSFET behaves like a resistor obeying Ohm's

68
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:17,639
Law.

69
00:05:17,639 --> 00:05:22,960
This is shown in the linear portions of the
I_DS curves at the left side of the plots.

70
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:26,960
The slope of the linear part of the curve
is essentially inversely proportional to the

71
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:30,439
resistance of the conducting MOSFET channel.

72
00:05:30,439 --> 00:05:35,330
As the channel gets thicker with increasing
V_GS, more current flows and the slope of

73
00:05:35,330 --> 00:05:40,840
the line gets steeper, indicating a smaller
channel resistance.

74
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:47,020
But when V_DS gets larger than V_GS, the channel
pinches off at the drain end and, as we see

75
00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:52,540
in on the right side of the I_DS plots, the
current flow no longer increases with increasing

76
00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:54,139
V_DS.

77
00:05:54,139 --> 00:06:01,300
Instead I_DS is approximately constant and
the curve becomes a horizontal line.

78
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:07,800
We say that the MOSFET has reached "saturation"
where I_DS has reached some maximum value.

79
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:12,889
Notice that the saturated part of the I_DS
curve isn't quite flat and I_DS continues

80
00:06:12,889 --> 00:06:16,580
to increase slightly as V_DS gets larger.

81
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:21,490
This effect is called channel-length modulation
and reflects the fact that the increase in

82
00:06:21,490 --> 00:06:26,570
channel pinch-off isn't exactly matched by
the increase current induced by the larger

83
00:06:26,570 --> 00:06:28,280
V_DS.

84
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:30,000
Whew!

85
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,639
MOSFET operation is complicated!

86
00:06:31,639 --> 00:06:37,090
Fortunately, as designers, we'll be able to
use the much simpler mental model of a switch

87
00:06:37,090 --> 00:06:42,870
if we obey some simple rules when designing
our MOSFET circuits.

88
00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:48,710
Up to now, we've been talking about MOSFETs
built as shown in the diagram on the left:

89
00:06:48,710 --> 00:06:53,020
with n-type source/drain diffusions in a p-type
substrate.

90
00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:59,569
These are called n-channel MOSFETs since the
inversion layer, when formed, is an n-type

91
00:06:59,569 --> 00:07:00,569
semiconductor.

92
00:07:00,569 --> 00:07:05,139
The schematic symbol for an n-channel MOSFET
is shown here, with the four terminals arranged

93
00:07:05,139 --> 00:07:07,169
as shown.

94
00:07:07,169 --> 00:07:12,070
In our MOSFET circuits, we'll connect the
bulk terminal of the MOSFET to ground, which

95
00:07:12,070 --> 00:07:16,270
will ensure that the voltage of the p-type
substrate is always less than or equal to

96
00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:20,199
the voltage of the source and drain diffusions.

97
00:07:20,199 --> 00:07:26,080
We can also build a MOSFET by flipping all
the material types, creating p-type source/drain

98
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:27,830
diffusions in a n-type substrate.

99
00:07:27,830 --> 00:07:33,659
This is called a p-channel MOSFET, which also
behaves as voltage-controlled switch, except

100
00:07:33,659 --> 00:07:36,689
that all the voltage potentials are reversed!

101
00:07:36,689 --> 00:07:41,870
As we'll see, control voltages that cause
an n-channel switch to be "on" will cause

102
00:07:41,870 --> 00:07:46,479
a p-channel switch to be "off" and vice-versa.

103
00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:52,569
Using both types of MOSFETs will give us switches
that behave in a complementary fashion.

104
00:07:52,569 --> 00:07:58,319
Hence the name "complementary MOS", CMOS for
short, for circuits that use both types of

105
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:00,039
MOSFETs.

106
00:08:00,039 --> 00:08:04,499
Now that we have our two types of voltage-controlled
switches, our next task is to figure out how

107
00:08:04,499 --> 00:08:09,610
to use them to build circuits useful for manipulating
information encoded as voltages.
