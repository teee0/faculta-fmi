00:00:00.830 --> 00:00:04.770
Our final challenge is figuring out how to
represent signed integers, for example, what

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:08.800
should be our representation for the number
-2000?

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:14.040
In decimal notation, the convention is to
precede the number with a "+" or "-" to indicate

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:18.400
whether it's positive or negative, usually
omitting the "+" to simplify the notation

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:22.580
for positive numbers.
We could adopt a similar notation -- called

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:28.430
"signed magnitude" -- in binary, by allocating
a separate bit at the front of the binary

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:33.830
string to indicate the sign, say "0" for positive
numbers and "1" for negative numbers.

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:39.010
So the signed-magnitude representation for
-2000 would be an initial "1" to indicate

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:43.570
a negative number, followed by the representation
for 2000 (as described on the previous two

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:47.540
slides).
However there are some complications in using

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:51.980
a signed-magnitude representation.
There are two possible binary representations

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:57.140
for zero: "+0" and "-0".
This makes the encoding slightly inefficient

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:02.300
but, more importantly, the circuitry for doing
addition of signed-magnitude numbers is different

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:07.220
than the circuitry for doing subtraction.
Of course, we're used to that – in elementary

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:12.330
school we learned one technique for addition
and another for subtraction.

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:17.580
To keep the circuitry simple, most modern
digital systems use the two's complement binary

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:22.390
representation for signed numbers.
In this representation, the high-order bit

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:27.370
of an N-bit two's complement number has a
negative weight, as shown in the figure.

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:32.100
Thus all negative numbers have a 1 in the
high-order bit and, in that sense, the high-order

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:37.640
bit is serving as the "sign bit" – if it's
1, the represented number is negative.

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:41.820
The most negative N-bit number has a 1-bit
in the high-order position, representing the

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:48.120
value -2^(N-1).
The most positive N-bit number has a 0 in

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:52.940
the negative-weight high-order bit and 1's
for all the positive-weight bits, representing

00:01:52.940 --> 00:02:00.030
the value 2^(N-1)-1.
This gives us the range of possible values

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:07.220
– for example, in an 8-bit two's complement
representation, the most negative number is

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:16.220
-2^7 = -128 and the most positive number is
2^7 – 1 = 127.

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:20.700
If all N bits are 1, think of that as the
sum of the most negative number with the most

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:31.120
positive number, i.e., -2^(N-1) + 2^(N-1)-1,
which equals -1.

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:38.030
And, of course, if all N bits are 0, that's
the unique representation of 0.

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:44.390
Let's see what happens when we add the N-bit
values for -1 and 1, keeping an N-bit answer.

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:49.280
In the rightmost column, 1 plus 1 is 0, carry
the 1.

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:54.280
In the second column, the carry of 1 plus
1 plus 0 is 0, carry the 1.

00:02:54.280 --> 00:03:00.400
And so on – the result is all zero's, the
representation for 0… perfect!

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:06.320
Notice that we just used ordinary binary addition,
even when one or both of the operands are

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:11.960
negative.
Two's complement is perfect for N-bit arithmetic!

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:17.710
To compute B - A, we can just use addition
and compute B + (-A).

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:22.239
So now we just need to figure out the two's
complement representation for –A, given

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:29.849
the two's complement representation for A.
Well, we know that A + (-A) = 0 and using

00:03:29.849 --> 00:03:34.870
the example above, we can rewrite 0 as 1 +
(-1).

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:41.650
Reorganizing terms, we see that –A equals
1 plus the quantity (-1) – A.

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:47.380
As we saw above, the two's complement representation
for -1 is all 1-bits, so we can write that

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:55.660
subtraction as all 1's minus the individual
bits of A: A_0, A_1, … up to A_N-1.

00:03:55.660 --> 00:04:05.290
If a particular bit A_i is 0, then 1-A_i = 1
and if A_i is 1, then 1-A_i = 0.

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:10.850
So in each column, the result is the bitwise
complement of A_i, which we'll write using

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:14.730
the C-language bitwise complement operator
tilde.

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:19.959
So we see that –A equals the bitwise complement
of A plus 1.

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:23.779
Ta-dah!
To practice your skill with two's complement,

00:04:23.779 --> 00:04:28.419
try your hand at the following exercises.
All you need to remember is how to do binary

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:33.480
addition and two's complement negation (which
is "bitwise complement and add 1").
