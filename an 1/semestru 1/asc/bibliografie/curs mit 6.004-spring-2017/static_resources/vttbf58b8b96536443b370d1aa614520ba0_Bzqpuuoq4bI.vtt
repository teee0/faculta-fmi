00:00:00.930 --> 00:00:06.190
In order to satisfy the static discipline,
a circuit must produce outputs that are better

00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:08.540
than the acceptable inputs.

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:13.830
This ensures that if you concatenate multiple
gates together, for example one buffer followed

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:19.320
by another buffer, then the input to each
gate will be valid even if a small amount

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:22.980
of noise was introduced by the previous gate.

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:27.850
So taking a closer look at that, what that
means is that if I have a valid input at my

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:33.640
first buffer, and I am guaranteeing that the
output that I produce is slightly better than

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:39.070
my original input, then even if a little bit
of noise was introduced, the input to the

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:43.720
second buffer is still going to be considered
a valid input.

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:50.579
More concretely, to satisfy the static discipline,
a valid low output must be less than a valid

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:52.200
low input.

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:57.070
The way that we specify this is that is that
Vol il.

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:01.950
Also, a valid high output must be greater
than a valid high input.

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:06.240
So Voh must be greater than Vih.

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:13.330
If we put this all together, we have Vol
il and Vih oh

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:18.101
and of course we want our low inputs to be
less than or equal to our high inputs, so

00:01:18.101 --> 00:01:22.920
Vil ih.

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:26.920
Another way to think about this is to look
at the orange and green arrows which show

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:31.810
the ranges of valid inputs which are wider
than the ranges of valid outputs.

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:36.310
The other thing that is shown here are the
noise margins which correspond to the area

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:40.310
of valid inputs but invalid outputs.

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:45.630
As we said earlier, a valid input must always
produce a valid output.

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:52.020
A valid input has Vin il
if its low or Vin > Vih

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.210
if its high.

00:01:54.210 --> 00:02:03.820
A valid output has Vout ol
if its low and Vout > Voh

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:10.239
if its high.

00:02:10.239 --> 00:02:15.950
In this problem, we want to determine whether
specifications 1, 2, and 3 (which provide

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:22.400
0.3 volt noise margins) satisfy the static
discipline given the voltage transfer curve

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:23.930
shown here.

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:28.689
For each specification, we need to check the
following two constraints:

00:02:28.689 --> 00:02:39.579
1) Is Vol il ih
oh - satisfying this constraint

00:02:39.579 --> 00:02:43.700
guarantees that the outputs produced are better
in quality than the inputs.

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:50.680
The second constraint is: Does a valid input
produce a valid output?

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:55.530
Since this curve shows an inverting function,
this translates to:

00:02:55.530 --> 00:03:01.680
a) Does a valid input (where Vin
il) always produce a valid high

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:05.620
output (where Vout > Voh)?

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:13.049
And b) Does a valid high input (where Vin
> Vih) always produce a valid low

00:03:13.049 --> 00:03:17.189
output (where Vout ol)?

00:03:17.189 --> 00:03:23.430
If all of these constraints are satisfied,
then that specification obeys the static discipline.

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:25.799
If not, it doesn't.

00:03:25.799 --> 00:03:34.339
For all three specifications, we see that
indeed Vol il ih

00:03:34.339 --> 00:03:40.599
oh, so the first constraint
is satisfied for all three specifications.

00:03:40.599 --> 00:03:47.650
Now let's check the second constraint.

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:56.699
For specification #1: If Vin il
which is equal to 0.4, then Vout

00:03:56.699 --> 00:04:04.559
= 5 which is greater than Voh which
is 4.9, so a valid low input produces a valid

00:04:04.559 --> 00:04:06.939
high output.

00:04:06.939 --> 00:04:13.879
If Vin > Vih which equals
4.6 then Vout equals 0 which is

00:04:13.879 --> 00:04:22.010
less than Vol which is 0.1, so
a valid high input produces a valid low output.

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:34.539
Since all of the constraints are satisfied,
specification #1 satisfies the static discipline.

00:04:34.539 --> 00:04:44.300
For specification #2: If Vin out >= 4 which is not greater

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:47.490
than> Voh which is 4.4.

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:54.729
So this specification does not satisfy the
static discipline.

00:04:54.729 --> 00:05:04.080
For specification #3: If Vin out >= 4 which in this case

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:07.740
is greater than Voh which is 3.9.

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:10.770
So the first part of the constraint checks
out.

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:15.229
Now we need to check what happens when we
have a valid high input.

00:05:15.229 --> 00:05:24.039
In this case, if Vin > 3.6 then
Vout ol

00:05:24.039 --> 00:05:28.949
or 1.1, so this part of the constraint checks
out as well.

00:05:28.949 --> 00:05:35.659
Since all the constraints are satisfied, that
means that specification #3 also satisfies

00:05:35.659 --> 00:05:36.830
the static discipline.
