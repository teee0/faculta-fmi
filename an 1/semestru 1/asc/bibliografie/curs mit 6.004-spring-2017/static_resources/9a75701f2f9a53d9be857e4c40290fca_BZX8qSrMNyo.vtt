00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:04.720
The truth table we've been using as an example
describes a very useful

00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:08.090
combinational device called a 2-to-1 multiplexer.

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:13.080
A multiplexer, or MUX for short, selects one
of its two input values

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:14.870
as the output value.

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:19.189
When the select input, marked with an S in
the diagram, is 0, the

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:23.769
value on data input D0 becomes the value of
the Y output.

00:00:23.769 --> 00:00:28.220
When S is 1, the value of data input D1 is
selected as the Y output

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:30.380
value.

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:34.430
MUXes come in many sizes, depending on the
number of select inputs.

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:39.120
A MUX with K select inputs will choose between
the values of 2^K data

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:40.120
inputs.

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:44.850
For example, here's a 4-to-1 multiplexer with
4 data inputs and 2

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:46.769
select inputs.

00:00:46.769 --> 00:00:53.060
Larger MUXes can be built from a tree of 2-to-1
MUXes, as shown here.

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:55.519
Why are MUXes interesting?

00:00:55.519 --> 00:00:58.980
One answer is that they provide a very elegant
and general way of

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.289
implementing a logic function.

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:04.360
Consider the 8-to-1 MUX shown on the right.

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:08.890
The 3 inputs — A, B, and CIN — are used
as the three select signals

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:09.890
for the MUX.

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:13.810
Think of the three inputs as forming a 3-bit
binary number.

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:18.360
For example, when they're all 0, the MUX will
select data input 0, and

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:23.908
when they're all 1, the MUX will select data
input 7, and so on.

00:01:23.908 --> 00:01:26.960
How does make it easy to implement the logic
function shown in the

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:27.970
truth table?

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:32.750
Well, we'll wire up the data inputs of the
MUX to the constant values

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:36.539
shown in the output column in the truth table.

00:01:36.539 --> 00:01:40.420
The values on the A, B and CIN inputs will
cause the MUX to select the

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:46.600
appropriate constant on the data inputs as
the value for the COUT output.

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:49.880
If later on we change the truth table, we
don't have to redesign some

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:53.360
complicated sum-of-products circuit, we simply
have to change the

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:56.000
constants on the data inputs.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.600
Think of the MUX as a table-lookup device
that can be reprogrammed to

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:03.789
implement, in this case, any three-input equation.

00:02:03.789 --> 00:02:06.820
This sort of circuit can be used to create
various forms of

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:10.139
programmable logic, where the functionality
of the integrated circuit

00:02:10.139 --> 00:02:13.950
isn't determined at the time of manufacture,
but is set during a

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:18.180
programming step performed by the user at
some later time.

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:21.209
Modern programmable logic circuits can be
programmed to replace

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:23.570
millions of logic gates.

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:26.660
Very handy for prototyping digital systems
before committing to the

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:32.640
expense of a custom integrated circuit implementation.

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:37.210
So MUXes with N select lines are effectively
stand-ins for N-input

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:38.959
logic circuits.

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:42.540
Such a MUX would have 2^N data inputs.

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:47.160
They're useful for N up to 5 or 6, but for
functions with more inputs,

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:51.250
the exponential growth in circuit size makes
them impractical.

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:54.920
Not surprisingly, MUXes are universal as shown
by these MUX-based

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:58.989
implementations for the sum-of-products building
blocks.

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:02.959
There is some speculation that in molecular-scale
logic technologies,

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:06.440
MUXes may be the natural gate, so it's good
to know they can be used

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:08.709
to implement any logic function.

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:13.920
Even XOR is simple to implement using only
2-to-1 MUXes!
