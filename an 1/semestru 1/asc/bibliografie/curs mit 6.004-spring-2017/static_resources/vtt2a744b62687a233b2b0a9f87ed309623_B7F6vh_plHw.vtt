00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:06.100
Network technologies were developed to connect
components (in this case individual computer

00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:13.769
systems) separated by larger distances, i.e.,
distances measured in meters instead of centimeters.

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:17.650
Communicating over these larger distances
led to different design tradeoffs.

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:23.020
In early networks, information was sent as
a sequence of bits over the shared communication

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:24.020
medium.

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:28.960
The bits were organized into packets, each
containing the address of the destination.

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:34.520
Packets also included a checksum used to detect
errors in transmission and the protocol supported

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:39.520
the ability to request the retransmission
of corrupted packets.

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:44.520
The software controlling the network is divided
into a "stack" of modules, each implementing

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.330
a different communication abstraction.

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:52.250
The lowest-level physical layer is responsible
for transmitting and receiving an individual

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:54.400
packet of bits.

00:00:54.400 --> 00:01:00.130
Bit errors are detected and corrected, and
packets with uncorrectable errors are discarded.

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:04.819
There are different physical-layer modules
available for the different types of physical

00:01:04.819 --> 00:01:06.350
networks.

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:10.490
The network layer deals with the addressing
and routing of packets.

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:15.280
Clever routing algorithms find the shortest
communication path through the multi-hop network

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:20.760
and deal with momentary or long-term outages
on particular network links.

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:25.370
The transport layer is responsible for providing
the reliable communication of a stream of

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:30.390
data, dealing with the issues of discarded
or out-of-order packets.

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:36.330
In an effort to optimize network usage and
limit packet loses due to network congestion,

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:42.000
the transport layer deals with flow control,
i.e., the rate at which packets are sent.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.590
A key idea in the networking community is
the notion of building a reliable communication

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:51.729
channel on top of a "best efforts" packet
network.

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:55.939
Higher layers of the protocol are designed
so that its possible to recover from errors

00:01:55.939 --> 00:01:57.280
in the lower layers.

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:04.119
This has proven to be much more cost-effective
and robust than trying to achieve 100% reliability

00:02:04.119 --> 00:02:06.400
at each layer.

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:10.799
As we saw in the previous section, there are
a lot of electrical issues when trying to

00:02:10.799 --> 00:02:15.760
communicate over a shared wire with multiple
drivers and receivers.

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:21.200
Slowing down the rate of communication helps
to solve the problems, but "slow" isn't in

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:25.629
the cards for today's high-performance systems.

00:02:25.629 --> 00:02:30.489
Experience in the network world has shown
that the fastest and least problematic communication

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:36.569
channels have a single driver communicating
with a single receiver, what's called a point-to-point

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:37.790
link.

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:41.040
Using differential signaling is particularly
robust.

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:44.739
With differential signaling, the receiver
measures the voltage difference across the

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:47.010
two signaling wires.

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:51.029
Electrical effects that might induce voltage
noise on one signaling wire will affect the

00:02:51.029 --> 00:02:57.950
other in equal measure, so the voltage difference
will be largely unaffected by most noise.

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:02.620
Almost all high-performance communication
links use differential signaling.

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:07.419
If we're sending digital data, does that mean
we also have to send a separate clock signal

00:03:07.419 --> 00:03:12.689
so the receiver knows when to sample the signal
to determine the next bit?

00:03:12.689 --> 00:03:16.379
With some cleverness, it turns out that we
can recover the timing information from the

00:03:16.379 --> 00:03:21.510
received signal assuming we know the nominal
clock period at the transmitter.

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:25.879
If the transmitter changes the bit its sending
at the rising edge of the transmitter's clock,

00:03:25.879 --> 00:03:30.769
then the receiver can use the transitions
in the received waveform to infer the timing

00:03:30.769 --> 00:03:33.139
for some of the clock edges.

00:03:33.139 --> 00:03:36.980
Then the receiver can use its knowledge of
the transmitter's nominal clock period to

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:40.689
infer the location of the remaining clock
edges.

00:03:40.689 --> 00:03:45.829
It does this by using a phase-locked loop
to generate a local facsimile of the transmitter's

00:03:45.829 --> 00:03:52.379
clock, using any received transitions to correct
the phase and period of the local clock.

00:03:52.379 --> 00:03:56.629
The transmitter adds a training sequence of
bits at the front of packet to ensure that

00:03:56.629 --> 00:04:01.620
the receiver's phased-lock loop is properly
synchronized before the packet data itself

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:03.040
is transmitted.

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:08.499
A unique bit sequence is used to separate
the training signal from the packet data so

00:04:08.499 --> 00:04:11.809
the receiver can tell exactly where the packet
starts

00:04:11.809 --> 00:04:16.339
even if it missed a few training bits while
the clocks were being properly synchronized.

00:04:16.339 --> 00:04:20.899
Once the receiver knows the timing of the
clock edges, it can then sample the incoming

00:04:20.899 --> 00:04:27.040
waveform towards the end of each clock period
to determine the transmitted bit.

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:31.650
To keep the local clock in sync with the transmitter's
clock, the incoming waveform needs to have

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:34.130
reasonably frequent transitions.

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:39.190
But if the transmitter is sending say, all
zeroes, how can we guarantee frequent-enough

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:41.500
clock edges?

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:47.510
The trick, invented by IBM, is for the transmitter
to take the stream of message bits and re-encode

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:52.540
them into a bit stream that is guaranteed
to have transitions no matter what the message

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:54.290
bits are.

00:04:54.290 --> 00:05:01.190
The most commonly used encoding is 8b10b,
where 8 message bits are encoded into 10 transmitted

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:07.180
bits, where the encoding guarantees a transition
at least every 6 bit times.

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:12.800
Of course, the receiver has to reverse the
8b10b encoding to recover the actual message

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:14.160
bits.

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:16.210
Pretty neat!

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:21.400
The benefit of this trick is that we truly
only need to send a single stream of bits.

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:25.900
The receiver will be able to recover both
the timing information and the data without

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:29.580
also needing to transmit a separate clock
signal.

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:33.750
Using these lessons, networks have evolved
from using shared communication channels to

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:36.560
using point-to-point links.

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:42.670
Today local-area networks use 10, 100, or
1000 BaseT wiring which includes separate

00:05:42.670 --> 00:05:48.470
differential pairs for sending and receiving,
i.e., each sending or receiving channel is

00:05:48.470 --> 00:05:53.090
unidirectional with a single driver and single
receiver.

00:05:53.090 --> 00:05:58.000
The network uses separate switches and routers
to receive packets from a sender and then

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.890
forward the packets over a point-to-point
link to the next switch,

00:06:01.890 --> 00:06:09.210
and so on, across multiple point-to-point
links until the packet arrives at its destination.

00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:14.580
System-level connections have evolved to use
the same communication strategy: point-to-point

00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:19.140
links with switches for routing packets to
their intended destination.

00:06:19.140 --> 00:06:24.110
Note that communication along each link is
independent, so a network with many links

00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:28.610
can actually support a lot of communication
bandwidth.

00:06:28.610 --> 00:06:33.020
With a small amount of packet buffering in
the switches to deal with momentary contention

00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:37.090
for a particular link,
this is a very effective strategy for moving

00:06:37.090 --> 00:06:42.510
massive amounts of information from one component
to the next.

00:06:42.510 --> 00:06:45.740
In the next section, we'll look at some of
the more interesting details.
