1
00:00:00,770 --> 00:00:03,790
And now we've reached the end of 6.004.

2
00:00:03,790 --> 00:00:08,200
Looking back, there are two ways of thinking
about the material we've discussed, the skills

3
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:12,379
we've practiced, and the designs we've completed.

4
00:00:12,379 --> 00:00:16,680
Starting at devices, we've worked our way
up the design hierarchy, each level serving

5
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:19,190
as building blocks for the next.

6
00:00:19,190 --> 00:00:23,380
Along the way we thought about design tradeoffs,
choosing the alternatives that would make

7
00:00:23,380 --> 00:00:30,370
our systems reliable, efficient and easy to
understand and hence easy to maintain.

8
00:00:30,370 --> 00:00:36,640
In the other view of 6.004, we created and
then used a hierarchy of engineering abstractions

9
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:41,330
that are reasonably independent of the technologies
they encapsulate.

10
00:00:41,330 --> 00:00:46,100
Even though technologies change at a rapid
pace, these abstractions embody principles

11
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:47,730
that are timeless.

12
00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:53,780
For example, the symbolic logic described
by George Boole in 1847 is still used to reason

13
00:00:53,780 --> 00:00:58,989
about the operation of digital circuits you
and I design today.

14
00:00:58,989 --> 00:01:03,490
The power of engineering abstractions is that
they allow us to reason about the behavior

15
00:01:03,490 --> 00:01:08,930
of a system based on the behavior of the components
without having to understand the implementation

16
00:01:08,930 --> 00:01:11,590
details of each component.

17
00:01:11,590 --> 00:01:16,329
The advantage of viewing components as "black
boxes" implementing some specified function

18
00:01:16,329 --> 00:01:23,170
is that the implementation can change as long
as the same specification is satisfied.

19
00:01:23,170 --> 00:01:28,450
In my lifetime, the size of a 2-input NAND
gate has shrunk by 10 orders of magnitude,

20
00:01:28,450 --> 00:01:33,439
yet a 50-year-old logic design would still
work as intended if implemented in today's

21
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:35,689
technologies.

22
00:01:35,689 --> 00:01:40,369
Imagine trying to build a circuit that added
two binary numbers if you had to reason about

23
00:01:40,369 --> 00:01:44,819
the electrical properties of doped silicon
and conducting metals.

24
00:01:44,819 --> 00:01:49,509
Using abstractions lets us limit the design
complexity at each level, shortening design

25
00:01:49,509 --> 00:01:54,600
time and making it easier to verify that the
specifications have been met.

26
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:58,719
And once we've created a useful repertoire
of building blocks, we can use them again

27
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:02,099
and again to assemble many different systems.

28
00:02:02,099 --> 00:02:07,590
Our goal in 6.004 is to demystify how computers
work, starting with MOSFETs and working our

29
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:09,919
way up to operating systems.

30
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:14,290
We hope you've understood the engineering
abstractions we've introduced and had a chance

31
00:02:14,290 --> 00:02:19,280
to practice using them when completing the
design problems offered in the labs.

32
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:24,200
We also hope that you'll also understand their
limitations and have the confidence to create

33
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:28,250
new abstractions when tackling new engineering
tasks.

34
00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:37,160
Good engineers use abstractions, but great
engineers create them.

35
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:40,640
principles used at each level of the design
hierarchy.

36
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:45,150
If a particular topic struck you as especially
interesting, we hope you'll seek out a more

37
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:49,900
advanced course that will let you dig deeper
into that engineering discipline.

38
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:54,120
Hundreds of thousands of engineers have worked
to create the digital systems that are the

39
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:56,320
engines of today's information society.

40
00:02:56,320 --> 00:03:02,760
As you can imagine, there's no end of interesting
engineering to explore and master - so roll

41
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:06,090
up your sleeves and come join in the fun!

42
00:03:06,090 --> 00:03:09,090
What will be the engineering challenges of
tomorrow?

43
00:03:09,090 --> 00:03:12,990
Here are a few thoughts about how the future
of computing may be very different than the

44
00:03:12,990 --> 00:03:13,990
present.

45
00:03:13,990 --> 00:03:17,260
The systems we build today have a well-defined
notion of state:

46
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:22,200
the exact digital values stored in their memories,
produced by their logic components, and traveling

47
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:24,390
along their interconnect.

48
00:03:24,390 --> 00:03:29,090
But computation based on the principles of
quantum mechanics may allow us to solve what

49
00:03:29,090 --> 00:03:34,990
are now intractable problems using states
described not as collections of 1's and 0's,

50
00:03:34,990 --> 00:03:41,440
but as interrelated probabilities that describe
the superposition of many states.

51
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:45,650
We've built our systems using voltages to
encode information and voltage-controlled

52
00:03:45,650 --> 00:03:51,100
switches to perform computation, using silicon-based
electrical devices.

53
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:55,350
But the chemistry of life has been carrying
out detailed manufacturing operations for

54
00:03:55,350 --> 00:04:01,220
millennia using information encoded as sequences
of amino acids.

55
00:04:01,220 --> 00:04:06,000
Some of the information encoded in our DNA
has been around for millions of years, a truly

56
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,900
long-lived information system!

57
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:13,360
Today biologists are starting to build computational
components from biological materials.

58
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:18,529
Maybe in 50 years instead of plugging in your
laptop, you'll have to feed it :)

59
00:04:18,529 --> 00:04:23,740
Instead of using truth tables and logic functions,
some computations are best performed neural

60
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:28,380
networks that operate by forming appropriately
weighted combinations of analog inputs,

61
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:32,400
where the weights are learned by the system
as it is trained using example inputs that

62
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:35,229
should produce known outputs.

63
00:04:35,229 --> 00:04:39,499
Artificial neural nets are thought to model
the operation of the synapses and neurons

64
00:04:39,499 --> 00:04:41,110
in our brains.

65
00:04:41,110 --> 00:04:46,010
As we learn more about how the brain operates,
we may get many new insights into how to implement

66
00:04:46,010 --> 00:04:51,159
systems that are good at recognition and reasoning.

67
00:04:51,159 --> 00:04:56,919
Again using living organisms as useful models,
programming may be replaced by learning, where

68
00:04:56,919 --> 00:05:00,629
stimulus and feedback are used to evolve system
behavior.

69
00:05:00,629 --> 00:05:05,999
In other words, systems will use adaptation
mechanisms to evolve the desired functionality

70
00:05:05,999 --> 00:05:09,270
rather than have it explicitly programmed.

71
00:05:09,270 --> 00:05:13,860
This all seems the stuff of science fiction,
but I suspect our parents feel the same way

72
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:18,250
about having conversations with Siri about
tomorrow's weather.

73
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:21,050
Thanks for joining us here in 6.004.

74
00:05:21,050 --> 00:05:25,009
We've enjoyed presenting the material and
challenging you with design tasks to exercise

75
00:05:25,009 --> 00:05:26,789
your new skills and understanding.

76
00:05:26,789 --> 00:05:31,539
There are interesting times ahead in the world
of digital systems and we can certainly use

77
00:05:31,539 --> 00:05:34,719
your help in inventing the future!

78
00:05:34,719 --> 00:05:38,629
We'd welcome any feedback you have about the
course so please feel free leave comments

in the forum.

80
00:05:39,729 --> 00:05:43,069
Good bye for now... and good luck in your
future studies.
